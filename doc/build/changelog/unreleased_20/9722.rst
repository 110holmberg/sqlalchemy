    Fixed issues regarding reflection of comments for :class:`_schema.Table`
    and :class:`_schema.Column` objects, where the comments contained control
    characters such as newlines. Additional testing support for these
    characters as well as extended Unicode characters in table and column
    comments (the latter of which aren't supported by MySQL/MariaDB) added to
    testing overall.
