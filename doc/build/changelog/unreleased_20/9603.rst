    Due to a critical bug identified in SQL Server, the SQLAlchemy
    "insertmanyvalues" feature which allows fast INSERT of many rows while also
    supporting RETURNING unfortunately needs to be disabled for SQL Server. SQL
    Server is apparently unable to guarantee that the order of rows inserted
    matches the order in which they are sent back by OUTPUT inserted when
    table-valued rows are used with INSERT in conjunction with OUTPUT inserted.
    We are trying to see if Microsoft is able to confirm this undocumented
    behavior however there is no known workaround, other than it's not safe to
    use table-valued expressions with OUTPUT inserted for now.
