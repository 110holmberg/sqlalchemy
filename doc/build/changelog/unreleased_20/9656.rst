    Added type :data:`_sql.ColumnExpressionArgument` as a public-facing type
    that indicates column-oriented arguments which are passed to SQLAlchemy
    constructs, such as :meth:`_sql.Select.where`, :func:`_sql.and_` and
    others. This may be used to add typing to end-user functions which call
    these methods.
