    :tags: feature, orm
    :tickets: 8126

    Added very experimental feature to the :func:`_orm.selectinload` and
    :func:`_orm.immediateload` loader options called
    :paramref:`_orm.selectinload.auto_recurse` /
    :paramref:`_orm.immediateload.auto_recurse` , which when set to True will
    cause a self-referential relationship load to continue loading with
    arbitrary depth until no further objects are found. This may be useful for
    self-referential structures that must be loaded fully eagerly, such as when
    using asyncio.
