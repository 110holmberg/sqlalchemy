    :tickets: 9142

    The newly added comment reflection and rendering capability of the MSSQL
    dialect, added in :ticket:`7844`, will now be disabled by default if it
    cannot be determined that an unsupported backend such as Azure Synapse may
    be in use; this backend does not support table and column comments and does
    not support the SQL Server routines in use to generate them as well as to
    reflect them. A new parameter ``supports_comments`` is added to the dialect
    which defaults to ``None``, indicating that comment support should be
    auto-detected. When set to ``True`` or ``False``, the comment support is
    either enabled or disabled unconditionally.
