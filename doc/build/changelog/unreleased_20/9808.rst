    Repaired the base :class:`.Uuid` datatype for the PostgreSQL dialect to
    make full use of the PG-specific ``UUID`` dialect-specific datatype when
    "native_uuid" is selected, so that PG driver behaviors are included. This
    issue became apparent due to the insertmanyvalues improvement made as part
    of :ticket:`9618`, where in a similar manner as that of :ticket:`9739`, the
    asyncpg driver is very sensitive to datatype casts being present or not,
    and the PostgreSQL driver-specific native ``UUID`` datatype must be invoked
    when this generic type is used so that these casts take place.
