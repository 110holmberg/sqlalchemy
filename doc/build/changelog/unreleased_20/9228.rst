    Fixed regression where using the :paramref:`_orm.Mapper.version_id_col`
    feature with a regular Python-side incrementing column would fail to work
    for SQLite and other databases that don't support "rowcount" with
    "RETURNING", as "RETURNING" would be assumed for such columns even though
    that's not what actually takes place.
