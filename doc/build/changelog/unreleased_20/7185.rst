    The SQLite dialect now supports UPDATE..FROM syntax, for UPDATE statements
    that may refer to additional tables within the WHERE criteria of the
    statement without the need to use subqueries. This syntax is invoked
    automatically when using the :class:`_dml.Update` construct when more than
    one table or other entity or selectable is used.
