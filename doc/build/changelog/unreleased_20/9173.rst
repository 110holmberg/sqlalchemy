    Fixed regression related to the implementation for the new
    "insertmanyvalues" feature where an internal ``TypeError`` would occur in
    arrangements where a :func:`_sql.insert` would be referred towards inside
    of another :func:`_sql.insert` via a CTE; made additional repairs for this
    use case for positional dialects such as asyncpg when using
    "insertmanyvalues".
