    Fixed issue in automap where calling :meth:`_automap.AutomapBase.prepare`
    from a specific mapped class, rather than from the
    :class:`_automap.AutomapBase` directly, would not use the correct base
    class when automap detected new tables, instead using the given class,
    leading to mappers trying to configure inheritance. While one should
    normally call :meth:`_automap.AutomapBase.prepare` from the base in any
    case, it shouldn't misbehave that badly when called from a subclass.
