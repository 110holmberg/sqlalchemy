    Fixed issue in automap where calling ``.prepare()`` from one of the mapped
    classes would not use the correct base class when automap detected new
    tables, instead using the given class, leading to mappers trying to
    configure inheritance. While one should normally call ``.prepare()`` from
    the base in any case, it shouldn't misbehave that badly when called from a
    subclass.
