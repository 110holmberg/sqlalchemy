    Fixed issue in :func:`_orm.mapped_column` construct where the correct
    warning for "column X named directly multiple times" would not be emitted
    when ORM mapped attributes referred to the same :class:`_schema.Column`, if
    the :func:`_orm.mapped_column` construct were involved, raising an internal
    assertion instead.
