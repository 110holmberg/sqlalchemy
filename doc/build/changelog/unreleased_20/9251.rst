    Fixed regression caused by issue :ticket:`9058` which adjusted the MySQL
    dialect's ``has_table()`` to again use "DESCRIBE", where the specific error
    code raised by MySQL version 8 when using a non-existent schema name was
    unexpected and failed to be interpreted as a boolean result.

    :tickets: 9251

    Fixed the SQLite dialect's ``has_table()`` function to correctly report
    False for queries that include a non-None schema name for a schema that
    doesn't exist; previously, a database error was raised.
