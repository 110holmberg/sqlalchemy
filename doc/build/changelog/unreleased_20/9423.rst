    Fixed regression involving pickling of Python rows between the cython and
    pure Python implementations of :class:`.Row`, which occurred as part of
    refactoring code for version 2.0 with typing. A particular constant were
    turned into a string based ``Enum`` for the pure Python version of
    :class:`.Row` whereas the cython version continued to use an integer
    constant, leading to deserialization failures.
