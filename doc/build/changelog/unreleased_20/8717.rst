    Added new parameter :paramref:`.PoolEvents.reset.reset_state` parameter to
    the :meth:`.PoolEvents.reset` event, with deprecation logic in place that
    will continue to accept event hooks using the previous set of arguments.
    This indicates various state information about how the reset is taking
    place and is used to allow custom reset schemes to take place with full
    context given.

    Within this change a fix that's also backported to 1.4 is included which
    re-enables the :meth:`.PoolEvents.reset` event to continue to take place
    under all circumstances, including when :class:`.Connection` has already
    "reset" the connection.

    The two changes together allow custom reset schemes to be implemented using
    the :meth:`.PoolEvents.reset` event, instead of the
    :meth:`.PoolEvents.checkin` event (which continues to function as it always
    has).
