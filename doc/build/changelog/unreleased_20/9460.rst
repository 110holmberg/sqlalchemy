    Fixed bug where the "active history" feature was not fully
    implemented for composite attributes, making it impossible to receive
    events that included the "old" value.   This seems to have been the case
    with older SQLAlchemy versions as well, where "active_history" would
    be propagated to the underlying column-based attributes, but an event
    handler listening to the composite attribute itself would not be given
    the "old" value being replaced, even if the composite() were set up
    with active_history=True.

    Additionally, fixed a regression that's local to 2.0 which disallowed
    active_history on composite from being assigned to the impl with
    ``attr.impl.active_history=True``.
