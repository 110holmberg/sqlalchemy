    :tickets: 9701

    Fixed critical regression caused by :ticket:`9618`, which modified the
    architecture of the :term:`insertmanyvalues` feature for 2.0.10, which
    caused floating point values to lose all decimal places when being inserted
    using the insertmanyvalues feature with either the psycopg2 or psycopg
    drivers.


.. change::
    :tags: bug, mssql

    Implemented the :class:`_sqltypes.Double` type for SQL Server, where it
    will render ``DOUBLE PRECISION`` at DDL time.  This is implemented using
    a new MSSQL datatype :class:`_mssql.DOUBLE_PRECISION` which also may
    be used directly.


.. change::
    :tags: bug, oracle

    Fixed issue in Oracle dialects where ``Decimal`` returning types such as
    :class:`_sqltypes.Numeric` would return floating point values, rather than
    ``Decimal`` objects, when these columns were used in the
    :meth:`_dml.Insert.returning` clause to return INSERTed values.
