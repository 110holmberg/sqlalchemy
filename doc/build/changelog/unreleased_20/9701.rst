    :tags: bug, postgresql, regression
    :tickets: 9701

    Fixed regression caused by the fix for :ticket:`9618` where floating point
    values would lose precision being inserted in bulk, using either the
    psycopg2 or psycopg drivers.


.. change::
    :tags: bug, mssql

    Implemented the :class:`_sqltypes.Double` type for SQL Server, having it
    resolve to ``DOUBLE PRECISION``, or :class:`_mssql.DOUBLE_PRECISION`,
    at DDL rendering time.


.. change::
    :tags: bug, oracle

    Fixed issue in Oracle dialects where ``Decimal`` returning types such as
    :class:`_sqltypes.Numeric` would return floating point values, rather than
    ``Decimal`` objects, when these columns were used in the
    :meth:`_dml.Insert.returning` clause to return INSERTed values.
