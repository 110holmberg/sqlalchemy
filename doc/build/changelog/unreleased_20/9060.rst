    Added a new parameter to :class:`_orm.Mapper` called
    :paramref:`_orm.Mapper.polymorphic_abstract`. The purpose of this directive
    is so that the ORM will not consider the class to be instantiated or loaded
    directly, only subclasses. The actual effect is that the
    :class:`_orm.Mapper` will prevent direct instantiation of instances
    of the class and will expect that the class does not have a distinct
    polymorphic identity configured.

    In practice, the class that is mapped with
    :paramref:`_orm.Mapper.polymorphic_abstract` can be used as the target of a
    :func:`_orm.relationship` as well as be used in queries; subclasses must of
    course include polymorphic identities in their mappings.

    The new parameter is automatically applied to classes that subclass
    the :class:`.AbstractConcreteBase` class, as this class is not intended
    to be instantiated.
