    Added detection for non-string, non-:class:`_engine.URL` objects to the
    :func:`_engine.make_url` function, allowing ``ArgumentError`` to be thrown
    immediately, rather than causing failures later on.  Special logic ensures
    that mock forms of :class:`_engine.URL` are allowed through.  Pull request
