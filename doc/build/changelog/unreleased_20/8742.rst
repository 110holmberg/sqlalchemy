    Fixed issues within the declarative typing resolver (i.e. which resolves
    ``ForwardRef`` objects) where types that were declared for columns in one
    particular source file would raise ``NameError`` when the ultimate mapped
    class were in another source file.  The types are now resolved in terms
    of the module for each class in which the types are used.
