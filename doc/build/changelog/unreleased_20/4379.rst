    :tags: performance, schema
    :tickets: 4379

    Rearchitected the schema reflection API to allow participating dialects to
    make use of high performing batch queries to reflect the schemas of many
    tables at once using fewer queries by an order of magnitude. The
    new performance features are targeted first at the PostgreSQL and Oracle
    backends, and may be applied to any dialect that makes use of SELECT
    queries against system catalog tables to reflect tables. The change also
    includes new API features and behavioral improvements to the
    :class:`.Inspector` object, including consistent, cached behavior of
    methods like :meth:`.Inspector.has_table`,
    :meth:`.Inspector.get_table_names` and new methods
    :meth:`.Inspector.has_schema` and :meth:`.Inspector.has_index`.
