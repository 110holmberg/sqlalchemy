    The "ping" query emitted when configuring
    :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.pool_pre_ping` for psycopg, asyncpg and
    pg8000, but not for psycopg2, has been changed to be an empty query (``;``)
    instead of ``SELECT 1``; additionally, for the asyncpg driver, the
    unnecessary use of a prepared statement for this query has been fixed.
    Rationale is to eliminate the need for PostgreSQL to produce a query plan
    when the ping is emitted. The operation is not currently supported by the
    ``psycopg2`` driver which continues to use ``SELECT 1``.
