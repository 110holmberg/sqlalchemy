    Fixed bug in ORM Declarative Dataclasses where the
    :func:`_orm.query_expression` and :func:`_orm.column_property`
    constructs, which are documented as read-only constructs in the context of
    a Declarative mapping, could not be used with a
    :class:`_orm.MappedAsDataclass` class without adding ``init=False``, which
    in the case of :func:`_orm.query_expression` was not possible as no
    ``init`` parameter was included. These constructs have been modified from a
    dataclass perspective to be assumed to be "read only", setting
    ``init=False`` by default and no longer including them in the pep-681
    constructor. The dataclass parameters for :func:`_orm.column_property`
    ``init``, ``default``, ``default_factory``, ``kw_only`` are now deprecated;
    these fields don't apply to :func:`_orm.column_property` as used in a
    Declarative dataclasses configuration where the construct would be
    read-only. Also added read-specific parameter
    :paramref:`_orm.query_expression.compare` to
    :func:`_orm.query_expression`; :paramref:`_orm.query_expression.repr`
    was already present.

    Added missing :paramref:`_orm.mapped_column.active_history` parameter
    to :func:`_orm.mapped_column` construct.
