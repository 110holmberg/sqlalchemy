    An explicit error is raised if a mapping attempts to mix the use of
    :class:`_orm.MappedAsDataclass` with
    :meth:`_orm.registry.mapped_as_dataclass` within the same class hierarchy,
    as this produces issues with the dataclass function being applied at the
    wrong time to the mapped class, leading to errors during the mapping
    process.
