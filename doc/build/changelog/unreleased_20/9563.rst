    Exceptions such as ``TypeError`` and ``ValueError`` raised by Python
    dataclasses when making use of the :class:`_orm.MappedAsDataclass` mixin
    class or :meth:`_orm.registry.mapped_as_dataclass` decorator are now
    wrapped within an :class:`.InvalidRequestError` wrapper along with
    informative context about the error message, referring to the Python
    dataclasses documentation as the authoritative source of background
    information on the cause of the exception.
