    Fixed 2.0 regression where use of :func:`_sql.bindparam()` inside of
    :meth:`_dml.Insert.values` would fail to be interpreted correctly when
    executing the :class:`_dml.Insert` statement using the ORM
    :class:`_orm.Session`, due to the new ORM-enabled insert feature not
    implementing this use case.

    In addition, the bulk INSERT and UPDATE features now add these
    capabilities:

    * The requirement that extra parameters aren't passed when using ORM
      INSERT using the "orm" dml_strategy setting is lifted.
    * The requirement that additional WHERE criteria is not passed when using
      ORM UPDATE using the "bulk" dml_strategy setting is lifted.  Note that
      in this case, the check for expected row count is turned off.
