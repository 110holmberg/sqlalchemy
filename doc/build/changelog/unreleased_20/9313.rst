    Fixed issue where element types of a tuple value would be hardcoded to take
    on the types from a compared-to tuple, when the comparison were using the
    :meth:`.ColumnOperators.in_` operator. This was inconsistent with the usual
    way that types are determined for a binary expression, which is that the
    actual element type on the right side is considered first before applying
    the left-hand-side type.
