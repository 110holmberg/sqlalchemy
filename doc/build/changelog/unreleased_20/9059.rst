    Supported use case for foreign key constraints where the local column is
    marked as "invisible". The errors normally generated when a
    :class:`.ForeignKeyConstraint` is created that check for the target column
    are disabled when reflecting, and the constraint is skipped with a warning
    in the same way which already occurs for an :class:`.Index` with a similar
    issue.
