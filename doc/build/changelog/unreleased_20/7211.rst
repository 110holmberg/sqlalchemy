    The :class:`.Sequence` construct restores itself to the DDL behavior it
    had prior to the 1.4 series, where creating a :class:`.Sequence` with
    no additional arguments will emit a simple ``CREATE SEQUENCE`` instruction
    **without** any additional parameters for "start value".   For most backends,
    this is how things worked previously in any case; **however**, for
    MS SQL Server, the default value on this database is
    ``-2**63``; to prevent this generally impractical default
    from taking effect on SQL Server, the :paramref:`.Sequence.start` parameter
    should be provided.   As usage of :class:`.Sequence` is unusual
    for SQL Server which for many years has standardized on ``IDENTITY``,
    it is hoped that this change has minimal impact.
