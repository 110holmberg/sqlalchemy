    Fixed issue where the :meth:`_orm.declared_attr.directive` modifier was not
    correctly honored for subclasses when applied to the ``__mapper_args__``
    special method name, as opposed to direct use of
    :class:`_orm.declared_attr`. The two constructs should have identical
    runtime behaviors.
