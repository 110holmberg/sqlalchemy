    :tags: bug, typing
    :tickets: 9129

    Added typing for the built-in generic functions that are available from the
    :data:`_sql.func` namespace, which accept a particular set of arguments and
    return a particular type, such as for :class:`_sql.count`,
    :class:`_sql.current_timestamp`, etc.
