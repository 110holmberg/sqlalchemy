    Improved row processing performance for "binary" datatypes by making the
    "bytes" handler conditional on a per driver basis.  As a result, the
    "bytes" result handler has been disabled for nearly all drivers other than
    psycopg2, all of which in modern forms support returning Python "bytes"
    directly.  Pull request courtesy J. Nick Koston.
