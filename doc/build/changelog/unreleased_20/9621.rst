    Restored the :paramref:`_postgresql.ENUM.name` parameter as optional in the
    signature for :class:`_postgresql.ENUM`, as this is chosen automatically
    from a given pep-435 ``Enum`` type.

    Fixed issue where the comparison for :class:`_postgresql.ENUM` against a
    plain string would cast that right-hand side type as VARCHAR, which due to
    more explicit casting added to dialects such as asyncpg would produce a
    PostgreSQL type mismatch error.
