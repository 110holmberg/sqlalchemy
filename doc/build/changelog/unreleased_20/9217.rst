    Fixed regression when using :meth:`_sql.Select.from_statement` in an ORM
    context, where matching of columns to SQL labels based on name alone was
    disabled for ORM-statements that weren't fully textual. This would prevent
    arbitrary SQL expressions with column-name labels from matching up to the
    entity to be loaded, which previously would work within the 1.4
    and previous series, so the previous behavior has been restored.
