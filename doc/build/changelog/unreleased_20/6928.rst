    Added new parameter :paramref:`_orm.Session.autobegin`, which when set to
    ``False`` will prevent the :class:`_orm.Session` from beginning a
    transaction implicitly. The :meth:`_orm.Session.begin` method must be
    called explicitly first in order to proceed with operations, otherwise an
    error is raised whenever any operation would otherwise have begun
    automatically. This option can be used to create a "safe"
    :class:`_orm.Session` that won't implicitly start new transactions.

    As part of this change, also added a new status variable
    :class:`_orm.SessionTransaction.origin` which may be useful for event
    handling code to be aware of the origin of a particular
    :class:`_orm.SessionTransaction`.
