    Removed the warning that emits when using ORM-enabled update/delete
    regarding evaluation of columns by name, first added in :ticket:`4073`;
    this warning actually covers up a scenario that otherwise could populate
    the wrong Python value for an ORM mapped attribute depending on what the
    actual column is, so this deprecated case is removed. In 2.0, ORM enabled
    update/delete uses "auto" for "synchronize_session", which should do the
    right thing automatically for any given UPDATE expression.
