    Fixed issue where comparisons to the :class:`_postgresql.CITEXT` datatype
    would cast the right side to ``VARCHAR``, leading to the right side not
    being interpreted as a ``CITEXT`` datatype, for the asyncpg, psycopg3 and
    pg80000 dialects.   This led to the :class:`_postgresql.CITEXT` type being
    essentially unusable for practical use; this is now fixed and the test
    suite has been corrected to properly assert that expressions are rendered
    correctly.
