    Improved the argument chacking on the
    :paramref:`_orm.registry.map_imperatively.local_table` parameter of the
    :meth:`_orm.registry.map_imperatively` method, ensuring only a
    :class:`.Table` or other :class:`.FromClause` is passed, and not an
    existing mapped class, which would lead to undefined behavior as the object
    were further interpreted for a new mapping.
