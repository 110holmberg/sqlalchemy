    Made an improvement to the :func:`_orm.with_loader_criteria` loader option
    to allow it to be indicated in the :meth:`.Executable.options` method of a
    top-level statement that is not itself an ORM statement. Examples include
    :func:`_sql.select` that's embedded in compound statements such as
    :func:`_sql.union`, within an :meth:`_dml.Insert.from_select` construct, as
    well as within CTE expressions that are not ORM related at the top level.
