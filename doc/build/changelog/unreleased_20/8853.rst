    Continued the fix for :ticket:`8853`, allowing the :class:`_orm.Mapped`
    name to be fully qualified regardless of whether or not
    ``from __annotations__ import future`` were present. This issue first fixed
    in 2.0.0b3 confirmed that this case worked via the test suite, however the
    test suite apparently was not testing the behavior for the name ``Mapped``
    not being locally present at all; string resolution has been updated to
    ensure the ``Mapped`` symbol is locatable as applies to how the ORM uses
    these functions.
