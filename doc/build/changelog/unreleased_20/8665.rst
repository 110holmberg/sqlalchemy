    Improved the :class:`.DeclarativeBase` class so that when combined with
    other mixins like :class:`.MappedAsDataclass`, the order of the classes may
    be in either order.

    Added support for mapped classes that are also ``Generic`` subclasses,
    to be specified as a ``GenericAlias`` object (e.g. ``MyClass[str]``)
    within statements and calls to :func:`_sa.inspect`.
