    Fixed issue where an annotation-only :class:`_orm.Mapped` directive could
    not be used in a Declarative mixin class, without that attribute attempting
    to take effect for single- or joined-inheritance subclasses of mapped
    classes that had already mapped that attribute on a superclass, producing
    conflicting column errors and/or warnings.
