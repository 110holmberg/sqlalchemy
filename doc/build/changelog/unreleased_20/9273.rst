    Fixed regression introduced in version 2.0.2 due to :ticket:`9217` where
    using DML RETURNING statements, as well as
    :meth:`_sql.Select.from_statement` constructs as was "fixed" in
    :ticket:`9217`, in conjunction with ORM mapped classes that used
    expressions such as with :func:`_orm.column_property`, would lead to an
    internal error within Core where it would attempt to match the expression
    by name. The fix repairs the Core issue, and also adjusts the fix in
    :ticket:`9217` to not take effect for the DML RETURNING use case, where it
    adds unnecessary overhead.
