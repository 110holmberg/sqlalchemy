    Improved the ruleset used to interpret :pep:`593` ``Annotated`` types when
    used with Annotated Declarative mapping, the inner type will be checked for
    "Optional" in all cases which will be added to the criteria by which the
    column is set as "nullable" or not; if the type within the ``Annotated``
    container is optional (or unioned with ``None``), the column will be
    considered nullable if there are no explicit
    :paramref:`_orm.mapped_column.nullable` parameters overriding it.
