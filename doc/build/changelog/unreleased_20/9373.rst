    Added support for the :paramref:`_orm.Mapper.polymorphic_load` parameter to
    be applied to each mapper in an inheritance hierarchy more than one level
    deep, allowing columns to load for all classes in the hierarchy that
    indicate ``"selectin"`` using a single statement, rather than ignoring
    elements on those intermediary classes that nonetheless indicate they also
    would participate in ``"selectin"`` loading and were not part of the
    base-most SELECT statement.
