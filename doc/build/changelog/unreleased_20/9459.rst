    Fixed reflection bug where Oracle "name normalize" would not work correctly
    for reflection of symbols that are in the "PUBLIC" schema, such as
    synonyms, meaning the PUBLIC name could not be indicated as lower case on
    the Python side for the :paramref:`_schema.Table.schema` argument. Using
    uppercase "PUBLIC" would work, but would then lead to awkward SQL queries
    including a quoted ``"PUBLIC"`` name as well as indexing the table under
    uppercase "PUBLIC", which was inconsistent.
