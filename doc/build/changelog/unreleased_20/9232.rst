    Fixed obscure ORM inheritance issue caused by :ticket:`8705` where some
    scenarios of inheriting mappers that indicated groups of columns from the
    local table and the inheriting table together under a
    :func:`_orm.column_property` would nonetheless warn that properties of the
    same name were being combined implicitly.
