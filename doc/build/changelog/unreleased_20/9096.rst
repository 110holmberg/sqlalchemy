    Fixes to the annotations within the ``sqlalchemy.ext.hybrid`` extension for
    more effective typing of user-defined methods. The typing now uses
    :pep:`612` features, now supported by recent versions of Mypy, to maintain
    argument signatures for :class:`.hybrid_method`. Return values for hybrid
    methods are accepted as SQL expressions in contexts such as
    :meth:`_sql.Select.where` while still supporting SQL methods.
