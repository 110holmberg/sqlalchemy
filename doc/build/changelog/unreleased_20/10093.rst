    Renamed :attr:`_result.Row.t` and :meth:`_result.Row.tuple` to
    :attr:`_result.Row._t` and :meth:`_result.Row._tuple`; this is to suit the
    policy that all methods and pre-defined attributes on :class:`.Row` should
    be in the style of Python standard library ``namedtuple`` where all fixed
    names have a leading underscore, to avoid name conflicts with existing
    column names.   The previous method/attribute is now deprecated and will
    emit a deprecation warning.
