    Fixed issue where string datatypes such as :class:`_sqltypes.CHAR`,
    :class:`_sqltypes.VARCHAR`, :class:`_sqltypes.TEXT`, as well as binary
    :class:`_sqltypes.BLOB`, could not be produced with an explicit length of
    zero, which has special meaning for MySQL. Pull request courtesy J. Nick
    Koston.
