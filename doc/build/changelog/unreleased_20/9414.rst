    :tags: bug, mssql
    :tickets: 9414

    Fixed issue in the new :class:`.Uuid` datatype which prevented it from
    working with the pymssql driver. As pymssql seems to be maintained again,
    restored testing support for pymssql.

.. change::
    :tags: bug, mssql

    Tweaked the pymssql dialect to take better advantage of
    RETURNING for INSERT statements in order to retrieve last inserted primary
    key values, in the same way as occurs for the mssql+pyodbc dialect right
    now.

.. change::
    :tags: bug, orm

    Identified that the ``sqlite`` and ``mssql+pyodbc`` dialects are now
    compatible with the SQLAlchemy ORM's "versioned rows" feature, since
    SQLAlchemy now computes rowcount for a RETURNING statement in this specific
    case by counting the rows returned, rather than relying upon
    ``cursor.rowcount``.  In particular, the ORM versioned rows use case
    (documented at :ref:`mapper_version_counter`) should now be fully
    supported with the SQL Server pyodbc dialect.
