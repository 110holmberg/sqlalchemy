    Added constructor arguments to the built-in mapping collection types
    including :class:`.KeyFuncDict`, :func:`_orm.attribute_keyed_dict`,
    :func:`_orm.column_keyed_dict` so that these dictionary types may be
    constructed in place given the data up front; this provides further
    compatibility with tools such as Python dataclasses ``.asdict()`` which
    relies upon invoking these classes directly as ordinary dictionary classes.
