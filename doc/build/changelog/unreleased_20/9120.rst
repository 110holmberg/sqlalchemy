    Corrected the type passed for "lambda statements" so that a plain lambda is
    accepted by mypy, pyright, others without any errors about argument types.
    Additionally implemented typing for more of the public API for lambda
    statements and ensured :class:`.StatementLambdaElement` is part of the
    :class:`.Executable` hierarchy so it's typed as accepted by
    :meth:`_engine.Connection.execute`.
