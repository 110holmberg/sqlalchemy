    Improved support for legacy 1.4 mappings that use annotations which don't
    include ``Mapped[]``, by ensuring the ``__allow_unmapped__`` attribute can
    be used to allow such legacy annotations to pass through Annotated
    Declarative without raising an error and without being interpreted in an
    ORM runtime context. Additionally improved the error message generated when
    this condition is detected, and added more documentation for how this
    situation should be handled. Unfortunately the 1.4 WARN_SQLALCHEMY_20
    migration warning cannot detect this particular configurational issue at
    runtime with its current architecture.
