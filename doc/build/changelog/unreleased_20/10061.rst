    Fixed some of the typing within the :func:`_orm.aliased` construct to
    correctly accept a :class:`.Table` object that's been aliased with
    :meth:`.Table.alias`, as well as general support for :class:`.FromClause`
    objects to be passed as the "selectable" argument, since this is all
    supported.
