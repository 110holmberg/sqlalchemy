    The :meth:`_orm.Session.refresh` method will now immediately load a
    relationship-bound attribute that is explicitly named within the
    :paramref:`_orm.Session.refresh.attribute_names` collection even if it is
    currently linked to the "select" loader, which normally is a "lazy" loader
    that does not fire off during a refresh. The "lazy loader" strategy will
    now detect that the operation is specifically a user-initiated
    :meth:`_orm.Session.refresh` operation which named this attribute
    explicitly, and will then call upon the "immediateload" strategy to
    actually emit SQL to load the attribute. This should be helpful in
    particular for some asyncio situations where the loading of an unloaded
    lazy-loaded attribute must be forced, without using the actual lazy-loading
    attribute pattern not supported in asyncio.
