    Generalized the MSSQL :func:`_sql.try_cast` function into the
    ``sqlalchemy.`` import namespace so that it may be implemented by third
    party dialects as well. Within SQLAlchemy, the :func:`_sql.try_cast`
    function remains a SQL Server-only construct that will raise
    :class:`.CompileError` if used with backends that don't support it.

    :func:`_sql.try_cast` implements a CAST where un-castable conversions are
    returned as NULL, instead of raising an error. Theoretically, the construct
    could be implemented by third party dialects for Google BigQuery, DuckDB,
    and Snowflake, and possibly others.
