    Added new feature to all included dialects that support RETURNING
    called "insertmanyvalues".  This is a generalization of the
    "fast executemany" feature first introduced for the psycopg2 driver
    in 1.4 at :ref:`change_5263`, which allows the ORM to batch INSERT
    statements into a much more efficient SQL structure while still being
    able to fetch newly generated primary key and SQL default values
    using RETURNING.

    The feature now applies to the many dialects that support RETURNING along
    with multiple VALUES constructs for INSERT, including all PostgreSQL
    drivers, SQLite, MariaDB, MS SQL Server. Separately, the Oracle dialect
    also gains the same capability using native cx_Oracle or OracleDB features.
