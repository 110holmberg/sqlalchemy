    Fixed bug in new ORM typed declarative mappings where the ability
    to use ``Optional[MyClass]`` or similar forms such as ``MyClass | None``
    in the type annotation for a many-to-one relationship was not implemented,
    leading to errors.   Documentation has also been added for this use
    case to the relationship configuration documentation.
