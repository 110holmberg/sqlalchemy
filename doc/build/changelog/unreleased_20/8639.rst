    Fixed bug in new "insertmanyvalues" feature where INSERT that included a
    subquery with :func:`_sql.bindparam` inside of it would fail to render
    correctly in "insertmanyvalues" format. This affected psycopg2 most
    directly as "insertmanyvalues" is used unconditionally with this driver.
