    Fixed regression where the fix for :ticket:`8098`, which was released in
    the 1.4 series and provided a layer of concurrency-safe checks for the
    lambda SQL API, included additional fixes in the patch that failed to be
    applied to the main branch. These additional fixes have been applied.
