    Added new feature to :class:`.AutomapBase` for autoload of classes across
    multiple schemas which may have overlapping names, by providing a
    :paramref:`.AutomapBase.prepare.modulename_for_table` parameter which
    allows customization of the ``__module__`` attribute of newly generated
    classes, as well as a new collection :attr:`.AutomapBase.by_module`, which
    stores a dot-separated namespace of module names linked to classes based on
    the ``__module__`` attribute.

    Additionally, the :meth:`.AutomapBase.prepare` method may now be invoked
    any number of times, with or without reflection enabled; only newly
    added tables that were not previously mapped will be processed on each
    call.   Previously, the :meth:`.MetaData.reflect` method would need to be
    called explicitly each time.

    .. seealso::

        :ref:`automap_by_module` - illustrates use of both techniques at once.
