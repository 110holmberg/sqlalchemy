    Fixed issue where setting a relationship collection directly, where an
    object in the new collection were already present, would not trigger a
    cascade event for that object, leading to it not being added to the
    :class:`_orm.Session` if it were not already present.  This is similar in
    nature to :ticket:`6471` and is a more apparent issue due to the removal of
    ``cascade_backrefs`` in the 2.0 series.  The
    :meth:`_orm.AttributeEvents.append_wo_mutation` event added as part of
    :ticket:`6471` is now also emitted for existing members of a collection
    that are present in a bulk set of that same collection.
