    Added support in ORM declarative annotations for class names specified for
    :func:`_orm.relationship`, as well as the name of the :class:`_orm.Mapped`
    symbol itself, to be different names than their direct class name, to
    support scenarios such as where :class:`_orm.Mapped` is imported as
    ``from sqlalchemy.orm import Mapped as M``, or where related class names
    are imported with an alternate name in a similar fashion. Additionally, a
    target class name given as the lead argument for :func:`_orm.relationship`
    will always supersede the name given in the left hand annotation, so that
    otherwise un-importable names that also don't match the class name can
    still be used in annotations.
