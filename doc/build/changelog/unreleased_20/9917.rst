    Fixed bug in new feature which allows a WHERE clause to be used in
    conjunction with :ref:`orm_queryguide_bulk_update`, added in version 2.0.11
    as part of :ticket:`9583`, where sending dictionaries that did not include
    the primary key values for each row would run through the bulk process and
    include "pk=NULL" for the rows, silently failing.   An exception is now
    raised if primary key values for bulk UPDATE are not supplied.
