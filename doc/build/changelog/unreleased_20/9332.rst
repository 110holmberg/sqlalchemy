    Fixed issue where new :paramref:`_orm.mapped_column.use_existing_column`
    feature would not work if the two same-named columns were mapped under
    attribute names that were differently-named from an explicit name given to
    the column itself. The attribute names can now be differently named when
    using this parameter.
