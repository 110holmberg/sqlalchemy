    The :meth:`.SQLCompiler.construct_params` method, as well as the
    :attr:`.SQLCompiler.params` accessor, will now return the
    exact parameters that correspond to a compiled statement that used
    the ``render_postcompile`` parameter to compile.   Previously,
    the method returned a parameter structure that by itself didn't correspond
    to either the original parameters or the expanded ones.

    Passing a new dictionary of parameters to
    :meth:`.SQLCompiler.construct_params` for a :class:`.SQLCompiler` that was
    constructed with ``render_postcompile`` is now disallowed; instead, to make
    a new SQL string and parameter set for an alternate set of parameters, a
    new method :meth:`.SQLCompiler.construct_expanded_state` is added which
    will produce a new expanded form for the given parameter set, using the
    :class:`.ExpandedState` container which includes a new SQL statement
    and new parameter dictionary, as well as a positional parameter tuple.
