    :tags: engine, performance
    :tickets: 9678

    Improved :class:`_engine.Row` implementation to optimize
    ``__getattr__`` performance.
    The serialization of a :class:`_engine.Row` to pickle has changed with
    this change. Pickle saved by older SQLAlchemy versions can still be loaded,
    but new pickle saved by this version cannot be loaded by older ones.
    Pull request curtesy of J. Nick Koston.
