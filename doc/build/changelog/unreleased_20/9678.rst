    A series of performance enhancements to :class:`_engine.Row`:

    * ``__getattr__`` performance of the row's "named tuple" interface has
      been improved; within this change, the :class:`_engine.Row`
      implementation has been streamlined, removing constructs and logic
      that were specific to the 1.4 and prior series of SQLAlchemy.
      As part of this change, the serialization format of :class:`_engine.Row`
      has been modified slightly, however rows which were pickled with previous
      SQLAlchemy 2.0 releases will be recognized within the new format.

    * Improved row processing performance for "binary" datatypes by making the
      "bytes" handler conditional on a per driver basis.  As a result, the
      "bytes" result handler has been removed for nearly all drivers other than
      psycopg2, all of which in modern forms support returning Python "bytes"
      directly.  Pull request courtesy J. Nick Koston.

    * Additional refactorings inside of :class:`_engine.Row` to improve
      performance by Federico Caselli.
