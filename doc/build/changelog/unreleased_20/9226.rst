    More adjustments to ORM Declarative Dataclasses mappings, building on the
    improved support for mixins with dataclasses added in 2.0.1 via
    :ticket:`9179`, where a combination of using mixins plus ORM inheritance
    would mis-classify fields in some cases leading to their dataclass
    arguments such as ``init=False`` being lost.
