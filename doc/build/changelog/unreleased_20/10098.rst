    Fixed additional regression caused by :ticket:`9805` where more aggressive
    propagation of the "ORM" flag on statements could lead to an internal
    attribute error when embedding an ORM :class:`.Query` construct that
    nonetheless contained no ORM entities within a Core SQL statement, in this
    case ORM-enabled UPDATE and DELETE statements.
