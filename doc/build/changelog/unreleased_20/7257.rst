    Migrated the codebase to remove all pre-2.0 behaviors and architectures
    that were previously noted as deprecated for removal in 2.0, including:

    * removal of all Python 2 code, minimum version is now Python 3.7

    * :class:`_engine.Engine` and :class:`_engine.Connection` now use the
      new 2.0 style of working, which includes "autobegin", library level
      autocommit removed, subtransactions and "branched" connections
      removed

    * Result objects use 2.0-style behaviors; :class:`_result.Row` is fully
      a named tuple without "mapping" behavior, use :class:`_result.RowMapping`
      for "mapping" behavior

    * All Unicode encoding/decoding architecture has been removed from
      SQLAlchemy.  All modern DBAPI implementations support Unicode
      transparently thanks to Python 3, so the ``convert_unicode`` feature
      as well as related mechanisms to look for bytestrings in
      DBAPI ``cursor.description`` etc. have been removed.

    * The ``.bind`` attribute and parameter from :class:`.MetaData`,
      :class:`.Table`, and from all DDL/DML/DQL elements that previously could
      refer to a "bound engine"

    * More are in progress as development continues
