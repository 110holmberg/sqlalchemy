    Implemented the "cartesian product warning" for UPDATE and DELETE
    statements, those which include multiple tables that are not correlated
    together in some way.

.. change::
    :tags: bug, sql

    Fixed issue where :func:`_dml.update` construct that included multiple
    tables and no VALUES clause would raise with an internal error. Current
    behavior for :class:`_dml.Update` with no values is to generate a SQL
    UPDATE statement with an empty "set" clause, so this has been made 
    consistent for this specific sub-case.
