    Added support for :pep:`484` ``NewType`` to be used in the
    :paramref:`_orm.registry.type_annotation_map` as well as within
    :class:`.Mapped` constructs. These types will behave in the same way as
    custom subclasses of types right now; they must appear explicitly within
    the :paramref:`_orm.registry.type_annotation_map` to be mapped.
