    The approach to the ``numeric`` pep-249 paramstyle has been rewritten, and
    is now fully supported, including by features such as "expanding IN" and
    "insertmanyvalues". Parameter names may also be repeated in the source SQL
    construct which will be correctly represented within the numeric format
    using a single parameter. Introduced an additional numeric paramstyle
    called ``numeric_dollar``, which is specifically what's used by the asyncpg
    dialect; the paramstyle is equivalent to ``numeric`` except numeric
    indicators are indicated by a dollar-sign rather than a colon. The asyncpg
    dialect now uses ``numeric_dollar`` paramstyle directly, rather than
    compiling to ``format`` style first.

    The ``numeric`` and ``numeric_dollar`` paramstyles assume that the target
    backend is capable of receiving the numeric parameters in any order,
    and will match the given parameter values to the statement based on
    matching their position (1-based) to the numeric indicator.  This is the
    normal behavior of "numeric" paramstyles, although it was observed that
    the SQLite DBAPI implements a not-used "numeric" style that does not honor
    parameter ordering.
