    Fixed critical regression in SQL expression formulation in the 2.0 series
    due to :ticket:`7744` which improved support for SQL expressions that
    contained many elements against the same operator repeatedly; parenthesis
    grouping would be lost with expression elements beyond the first two
    elements.
