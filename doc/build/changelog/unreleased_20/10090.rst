    Fixed issue where objects that were associated with an unloaded collection
    via backref, but were not merged into the :class:`_orm.Session` due to the
    removal of ``cascade_backrefs`` in the 2.0 series, would not emit a warning
    that these objects were not being included in a flush, even though they
    were pending members of the collection; in other such cases, a warning is
    emitted when a collection being flushed contains non-attached objects which
    will be essentially discarded.  The addition of the warning for
    backref-pending collection members establishes greater consistency with
    collections that may be present or non-present and possibly flushed or not
    flushed at different times based on different relationship loading
    strategies.
