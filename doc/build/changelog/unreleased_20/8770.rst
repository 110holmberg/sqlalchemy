    Adjusted the rendering of ``RETURNING``, in particular when using
    :class:`_sql.Insert`, such that it now renders columns using the same logic
    as that of the :class:`.Select` construct to generate labels, which will
    include disambiguating labels, as well as that a SQL function surrounding a
    named column will be labeled using the column name itself. This establishes
    better cross-compatibility when selecting rows from either :class:`.Select`
    constructs or from DML statements that use :meth:`.UpdateBase.returning`. A
    narrower scale change was also made for the 1.4 series that adjusted the
    function label issue only.
