    :tickets: 9321

    Improved the typing support for the :ref:`hybrids_toplevel`
    extension, updated all documentation to use ORM Annotated Declarative
    mappings, and added a new modifier called :attr:`.hybrid_property.inplace`.
    This modifier provides a way to alter the state of a :class:`.hybrid_property`
    **in place**, which is essentially what very early versions of hybrids
    did, before SQLAlchemy version 1.2.0 :ticket:`3912` changed this to
    remove in-place mutation.  This in-place mutation is now restored on an
    **opt-in** basis to allow a single hybrid to have multiple methods
    set up, without the need to name all the methods the same and without the
    need to carefully "chain" differently-named methods in order to maintain
    the composition.  Typing tools such as Mypy and Pyright do not allow
    same-named methods on a class, so with this change a succinct method
    of setting up hybrids with typing support is restored.
