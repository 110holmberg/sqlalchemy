    Fixed bug in :ref:`orm_declarative_native_dataclasses` feature where using
    plain dataclass fields with the ``__allow_unmapped__`` directive in a
    mapping would not create a dataclass with the correct class-level state for
    those fields, copying the raw ``Field`` object to the class inappropriately
    after dataclasses itself had replaced the ``Field`` object with the
    class-level default value.
