    Fixed issue where using a pep-593 ``Annotated`` type in the
    :paramref:`_orm.registry.type_annotation_map` which itself contained a
    generic plain container or ``collections.abc`` type (e.g. ``list``,
    ``dict``, ``collections.abc.Sequence``, etc. ) as the target type would
    produce an internal error when the ORM were trying to interpret the
    ``Annotated`` instance.
