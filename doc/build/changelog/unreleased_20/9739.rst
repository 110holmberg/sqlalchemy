    Fixed another regression due to the "insertmanyvalues" change in 2.0.10 as
    part of :ticket:`9618`, in a similar way as regression :ticket:`9701`, where
    :class:`.LargeBinary` datatypes also need additional casts on when using the
    asyncpg driver specifically in order to work with the new bulk INSERT
    format.
