    Fixed regression where the :func:`_sql.select` construct would not be able
    to render if it were given no columns and then used in the context of an
    EXISTS, raising an internal exception instead. While an empty "SELECT" is
    not typically valid SQL, in the context of EXISTS databases such as
    PostgreSQL allow it, and in any case the condition now no longer raises
    an internal exception.
