    :tags: usecase, orm declarative
    :tickets: 9266

    Added new parameter ``dataclasses_callable`` to both the
    :class:`_orm.MappedAsDataclass` class as well as the
    :meth:`_orm.registry.mapped_as_dataclass` method which allows an
    alternative callable to Python ``dataclasses.dataclass`` to be used in
    order to produce dataclasses. The use case here is to drop in Pydantic's
    dataclass function instead. Adjustments have been made to the mixin support
    added for :ticket:`9179` in version 2.0.1 so that the ``__annotations__``
    collection of the mixin is rewritten to not include the
    :class:`_orm.Mapped` container, in the same way as occurs with mapped
    classes, so that the Pydantic dataclasses constructor is not exposed to
    unknown types.
