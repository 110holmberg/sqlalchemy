    Repaired ORM Declarative mappings to allow for the
    :paramref:`_orm.Mapper.primary_key` parameter to be specified within
    ``__mapper_args__`` when using :func:`_orm.mapped_column`. Despite this
    usage being directly in the 2.0 documentation, the :class:`_orm.Mapper` was
    not accepting the :func:`_orm.mapped_column` construct in this context. Ths
    feature was already working for the :paramref:`_orm.Mapper.version_id_col`
    and :paramref:`_orm.Mapper.polymorphic_on` parameters.

    As part of this change, the ``__mapper_args__`` attribute may be specified
    without using :func:`_orm.declared_attr` on a non-mapped mixin class,
    including a ``"primary_key"`` entry that refers to :class:`_schema.Column`
    or :func:`_orm.mapped_column` objects locally present on the mixin;
    Declarative will also translate these columns into the correct ones for a
    particular mapped class. This again was working already for the
    :paramref:`_orm.Mapper.version_id_col` and
    :paramref:`_orm.Mapper.polymorphic_on` parameters.  Additionally,
    elements within ``"primary_key"`` may be indicated as string names of
    existing mapped properties.
