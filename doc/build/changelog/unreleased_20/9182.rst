    Improved the error reporting when linking strategy options from a base
    class to another attribute that's off a subclass, where ``of_type()``
    should be used. Previously, when :meth:`.Load.options` is used, the message
    would lack informative detail that ``of_type()`` should be used, which was
    not the case when linking the options directly. The informative detail now
    emits even if :meth:`.Load.options` is used.
