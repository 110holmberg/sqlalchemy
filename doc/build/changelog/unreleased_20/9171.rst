    Fixed regression in :class:`.DeclarativeBase` class where the registry's
    default constructor would not be applied to the base itself, which is
    different from how the previous :func:`_orm.declarative_base` construct
    works. This would prevent a mapped class with its own ``__init__()`` method
    from calling ``super().__init__()`` in order to access the registry's
    default constructor and automatically populate attributes, instead hitting
    ``object.__init__()`` which would raise a ``TypeError`` on any arguments.
