    Fixed issue in CTE constructs mostly relevant to ORM use cases where a
    recursive CTE against "anonymous" labels such as those seen in ORM
    ``column_property()`` mappings would render in the
    ``WITH RECURSIVE xyz(...)`` section as their raw internal label and not a
    cleanly anonymized name.
