    Revised the :paramref:`.Connection.execution_options.schema_translate_map`
    feature such that the processing of the SQL statement to receive a specific
    schema name occurs within the execution phase of the statement, rather than
    at the compile phase.   This is to support the statement being efficiently
    cached.   Previously, the current schema being rendered into the statement
    for a particular run would be considered as part of the cache key itself,
    meaning that for a run against hundreds of schemas, there would be hundreds
    of cache keys, rendering the cache much less performant.  The new behavior
    is that the rendering is done in a similar  manner as the "post compile"
    rendering added in 1.4 as part of :ticket:`4645`, :ticket:`4808`.
