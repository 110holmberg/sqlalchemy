    Fixed regression caused by the fix for :ticket:`8231` released in 1.4.40
    where connection would fail if the user did not have permission to query
    the ``dm_exec_sessions`` or ``dm_pdw_nodes_exec_sessions`` system views
    when trying to determine the current transaction isolation level.
