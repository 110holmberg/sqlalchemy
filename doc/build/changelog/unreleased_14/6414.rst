    Fixed regression where :meth:`_orm.Query.filter_by` would not work if the
    lead entity were a SQL function or other expression derived from the
    primary entity in question, rather than a simple entity or column of that
    entity. Additionally, improved the behavior of
    :meth:`_sql.Select.filter_by` overall to work with column expressions even
    in a non-ORM context.
