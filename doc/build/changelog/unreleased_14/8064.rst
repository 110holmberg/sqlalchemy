    Fixed issue where using a :func:`_orm.column_property` construct containing
    a subquery against an already-mapped column attribute would not correctly
    apply ORM-compilation behaviors to the subquery, including that the "IN"
    expression added for a single-table inherits expression would fail to be
    included.
