    Fixed issue where using the PostgreSQL "INSERT..ON CONFLICT" structure
    would fail to work with the psycopg2 driver if it were used in an
    "executemany" context along with bound parameters in the "SET" clause, due
    to the implicit use of the psycopg2 fast execution helpers which are not
    appropriate for this style of INSERT statement. Additional checks to
    exclude this kind of statement from that particular extension have been
    added.
