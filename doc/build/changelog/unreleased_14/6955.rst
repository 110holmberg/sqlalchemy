    Added loader options to :meth:`_orm.Session.merge` and
    :meth:`_asyncio.AsyncSession.merge` via a new
    :paramref:`_orm.Session.merge.options` parameter, which will apply the
    given loader options to the ``get()`` used internally by merge, allowing
    eager loading of relationships etc. to be applied when the merge process
    loads a new object. Pull request courtesy Daniel Stone.
