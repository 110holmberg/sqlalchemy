    Added new parameter :paramref:`_sql.HasCTE.cte.nesting` to the
    :class:`_sql.CTE` constructor and :meth:`_sql.HasCTE.cte` method, which
    flags the CTE as one which should remain nested within an enclosing CTE,
    rather than being moved to the top level of the outermost SELECT. While in
    the vast majority of cases there is no difference in SQL functionality,
    users have identified various edge-cases where true nesting of CTE
    constructs is desirable. Much thanks to Eric Masseran for lots of work on
    this intricate feature.
