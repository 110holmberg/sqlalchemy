    Improved the unit of work topological sorting system such that the
    toplogical sort is now deterministic based on the sorting of the input set,
    which itself is now sorted at the level of mappers, so that the same inputs
    of affected mappers should produce the same output every time, among
    mappers / tables that don't have any dependency on each other. This further
    reduces the chance of deadlocks as can be observed in a flush that UPDATEs
    among multiple, unrelated tables such that row locks are generated.
