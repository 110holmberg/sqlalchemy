    Added new method :meth:`.AdaptedConnection.run_async` to the DBAPI
    connection interface used by asyncio drivers, which allows methods to be
    called against the underlying "driver" connection directly within a
    sync-style function where the ``await`` keyword can't be used, such as
    within SQLAlchemy event handler functions. The method is analogous to the
    :meth:`_asyncio.AsyncConnection.run_sync` method which translates
    async-style calls to sync-style. The method is useful for things like
    connection-pool on-connect handlers that need to invoke awaitable methods
    on the driver connection when it's first created.
