    An informative exception is now raised when the
    :func:`_orm.with_loader_criteria` option is used as a loader option added
    to a specific "loader path", such as when using it within
    :meth:`.Load.options`. This use is not supported as
    :func:`_orm.with_loader_criteria` is only intended to be used as a top
    level loader option. Previously, an internal error would be generated.
