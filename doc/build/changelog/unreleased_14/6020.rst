    The ``sqlalchemy.ext.mutable`` extension now tracks the "parents"
    collection using the :class:`.InstanceState` associated with objects,
    rather than the object itself. The latter approach required that the object
    be hashable so that it can be inside of a ``WeakKeyDictionary``, which goes
    against the behavioral contract of the ORM overall which is that ORM mapped
    objects do not need to provide any particular kind of ``__hash__()`` method
    and that unhashable objects are supported.
