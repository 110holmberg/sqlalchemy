    Fixed ORM regression where the new behavior of "eager loaders run on
    unexpire" added in :ticket:`1763` would lead to loader option errors being
    raised inappropriately for the case where a single :class:`_orm.Query` or
    :class:`_sql.Select` were used to load multiple kinds of entities, along
    with loader options that apply to just one of those kinds of entity like a
    :func:`_orm.joinedload`, and later the objects would be refreshed from
    expiration, where the loader options would attempt to be applied to the
    mismatched object type and then raise an exception. The check for this
    mismatch now bypasses raising an error for this case.
