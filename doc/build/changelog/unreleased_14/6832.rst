    Improve the interface used by adapted drivers, like the asyncio ones,
    to access the actual connection object returned by the driver.

    The :class:`._ConnectionFairy` object has two new attributes:

    * :attr:`._ConnectionFairy.dbapi_connection` always represents a DBAPI
      compatible object. For pep-249 drivers, this is the DBAPI connection as
      it always has been, previously accessed under the ``.connection``
      attribute. For asyncio drivers that SQLAlchemy adapts into a pep-249
      interface, the returned object will normally be a SQLAlchemy adaption
      object called :class:`_engine.AdaptedConnection`.
    * :attr:`._ConnectionFairy.driver_connection` always represents the actual
      connection object maintained by the third party pep-249 DBAPI or async
      driver in use. For standard pep-249 DBAPIs, this will always be the same
      object as that of the ``dbapi_connection``. For an asyncio driver, it
      will be the underlying asyncio-only connection object.

    The ``.connection`` attribute remains available and is now a legacy alias
    of ``.dbapi_connection``.
