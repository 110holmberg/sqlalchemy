    Fixed regression where the :class:`.ConcreteBase` would fail to map at all
    when a mapped column name overlapped with the discriminator column name,
    producing an assertion error. The use case here did not function correctly
    in 1.3 as the polymorphic union would produce a query that ignored the
    discriminator column entirely, while emitting duplicate column warnings. As
    1.4's architecture cannot easily reproduce this essentially broken behavior
    of 1.3 at the ``select()`` level right now, the use case now raises an
    informative error message instructing the user to use the
    ``.ConcreteBase._concrete_discriminator_name`` attribute to resolve the
    conflict. To assist with this configuration,
    ``.ConcreteBase._concrete_discriminator_name`` may be placed on the base
    class only where it will be automatically used by subclasses; previously
    this was not the case.
