    Added support for inspection / reflection of partial indexes / filtered
    indexes, i.e. those which use the ``mssql_where`` or ``postgresql_where``
    parameters, with :class:`_schema.Index`.   The entry is both part of the
    dictionary returned by :meth:`.Inspector.get_indexes` as well as part of a
    reflected :class:`_schema.Index` construct that was reflected.  Pull
    request courtesy Ramon Williams.
