    Executing a :class:`_sql.Subquery` using :meth:`_engine.Connection.execute`
    is deprecated and will emit a deprecation warning; this use case was an
    oversight that should have been removed from 1.4. The operation will now
    execute the underlying :class:`_sql.Select` object directly for backwards
    compatibility. Similarly, the :class:`_sql.CTE` class is also not
    appropriate for execution. In 1.3, attempting to execute a CTE would result
    in an invalid "blank" SQL statement being executed; since this use case was
    not working it now raises :class:`_exc.ObjectNotExecutableError`.
    Previously, 1.4 was attempting to execute the CTE as a statement however it
    was working only erratically.
