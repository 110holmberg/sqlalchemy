    Fixed issue in the new feature of :meth:`_orm.Session.refresh` introduced
    by :ticket:`1763` where eagerly loaded relationships are also refreshed,
    where the ``lazy="raise"`` and ``lazy="raise_on_sql"`` loader strategies
    would interfere with the :func:`_orm.immediateload` loader strategy, thus
    breaking the feature for relationships that were loaded with
    :func:`_orm.selectinload`, :func:`_orm.subqueryload` as well.
