    Enhanced the "expanding" feature used for :meth:`_sql.ColumnOperators.in_`
    operations to infer the type of expression from the right hand list of
    elements, if the left hand side does not have any explicit type set up.
    This allows the expression to support stringification among other things.
    In 1.3, "expanding" was not automatically used for
    :meth:`_sql.ColumnOperators.in_` expressions, so in that sense this change
    fixes a behavioral regression.
