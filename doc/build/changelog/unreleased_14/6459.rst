    Fixed issue in subquery loader strategy which prevented caching from
    working correctly. This would have been seen in the logs as a "generated"
    message instead of "cached" for all subqueryload SQL emitted, which by
    saturating the cache with new keys would degrade overall performance; it
    also would produce "LRU size alert" warnings.
