    When using an asyncio engine, the connection pool will now detach and
    discard a pooled connection that is was not explicitly closed/returned to
    the pool when its tracking object is garbage collected, emitting a warning
    that the connection was not properly closed.   As this operation occurs
    during Python gc finalizers, it's not safe to run any IO operations upon
    the connection including transaction rollback or connection close as this
    will often be outside of the event loop.
