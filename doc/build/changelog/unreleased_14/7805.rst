    Added :paramref:`_orm.with_polymorphic.adapt_on_names` to the
    :func:`_orm.with_polymorphic` function, which allows a polymorphic load
    (typically with concrete mapping) to be stated against an alternative
    selectable that will adapt to the original mapped selectable on column
    names alone.
