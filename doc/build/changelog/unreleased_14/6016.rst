    Fixed bug where the "percent escaping" feature that occurs with dialects
    that use the "format" or "pyformat" bound parameter styles was not enabled
    for the :meth:`_sql.Operators.op` and :class:`_sql.custom_op` constructs,
    for custom operators that use percent signs. The percent sign will now be
    automatically doubled based on the paramstyle as necessary.
