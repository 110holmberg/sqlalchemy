    SQLAlchemy now includes support for Python asyncio within both Core and
    ORM, using the included :ref:`asyncio extension <asyncio_toplevel>`. The
    extension makes use of the `greenlet
    <https://greenlet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ library in order to adapt
    SQLAlchemy's sync-oriented internals such that an asyncio interface that
    ultimately interacts with an asyncio database adapter is now feasible.  The
    single driver supported at the moment is the
    :ref:`dialect-postgresql-asyncpg` driver for PostgreSQL.
