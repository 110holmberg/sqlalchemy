    Added new execution option
    :paramref:`_engine.Connection.execution_options.logging_token`. This option
    will add an additional per-message token to log messages generated by the
    :class:`_engine.Connection` as it executes statements. This token is not
    part of the logger name itself (that part can be affected using the
    existing :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.logging_name` parameter), so is
    appropriate for ad-hoc connection use without the side effect of creating
    many new loggers. The option can be set at the level of
    :class:`_engine.Connection` or :class:`_engine.Engine`.
