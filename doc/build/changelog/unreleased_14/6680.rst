    Fixed regression in ORM regarding an internal reconstitution step for the
    func:`_orm.with_polymorphic` construct, when the user-facing object is
    garbage collected as the query is processed. The reconstitution was not
    ensuring the sub-entities for the "polymorphic" case were handled, leading
    to an ``AttributeError``.
