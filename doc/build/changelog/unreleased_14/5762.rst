	The :func:`_orm.with_loader_criteria` option has been modified so that it
	will never apply its criteria to the SELECT statement for an ORM refresh
	operation, such as that invoked by :meth:`_orm.Session.refresh` or whenever
	an expired attribute is loaded.   These queries are only against the
	primary key row of the object that is already present in memory so there
	should not be additional criteria added.
