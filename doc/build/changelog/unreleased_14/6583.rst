    Implemented :class:`_asyncio.async_scoped_session` to address some
    asyncio-related incompatibilities between :class:`_orm.scoped_session` and
    :class:`_asyncio.AsyncSession`, in which some methods (notably the
    :meth:`_asyncio.async_scoped_session.remove` method) should be used with
    the ``await`` keyword.
