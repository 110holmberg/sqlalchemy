    Fixed issue where the PostgreSQL ``ENUM`` datatype as embedded in the
    ``ARRAY`` datatype would fail to emit correctly in create/drop when the
    ``schema_translate_map`` feature were also in use. Additionally repairs a
    related issue where the same ``schema_translate_map`` feature would not
    work for the ``ENUM`` datatype in combination with a ``CAST``, that's also
    intrinsic to how the ``ARRAY(ENUM)`` combination works on the PostgreSQL
    dialect.
