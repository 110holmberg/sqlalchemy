    An informative error is raised for the use case where
    :meth:`.Insert.from_select` is being passed a "compound select" object such
    as a UNION, yet the INSERT statement needs to append additional columns to
    support Python-side or explicit SQL defaults from the table metadata. In
    this case a subquery of the compound object should be passed.
