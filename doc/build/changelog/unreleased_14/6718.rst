    Fixed ORM regression where ad-hoc label names generated for hybrid
    properties and potentially other similar types of ORM-enabled expressions
    would usually be propagated outwards through subqueries, allowing the name
    to be retained in the final keys of the result set even when selecting from
    subqueries. Additional state is now tracked in this case that isn't lost
    when a hybrid is selected out of a Core select / subquery.
