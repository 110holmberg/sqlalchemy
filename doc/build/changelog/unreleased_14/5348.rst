    Fixed an issue in the C extension for the :class:`_result.Row` class which
    could lead to a memory leak in the unlikely case of a :class:`_result.Row`
    object which referred to an ORM object that then was mutated to refer back
    to the ``Row`` itself, creating a cycle. The Python C APIs for tracking GC
    cycles has been added to the native :class:`_result.Row` implementation to
    accommodate for this case.
