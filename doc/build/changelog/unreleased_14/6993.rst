    Added initial support for the ``asyncmy`` asyncio database driver for MySQL
    and MariaDB. This driver is very new, however appears to be the only
    current alternative to the ``aiomysql`` driver which currently appears to
    be unmaintained and is not working with current Python versions. Much
    thanks to long2ice for the pull request for this dialect.
