    Implemented support for "table valued functions" along with additional
    syntaxes supported by PostgreSQL, one of the most commonly requested
    features. Table valued functions are SQL functions that return lists of
    values or rows, and are prevalent in PostgreSQL in the area of JSON
    functions, where the "table value" is commonly referred towards as the
    "record" datatype. Table valued functions are also supported by Oracle and
    SQL Server.

    Features added include:

    * the :meth:`_functions.FunctionElement.table_valued` modifier that creates a table-like
      selectable object from a SQL function
    * A :class:`_sql.TableValuedAlias` construct that renders a SQL function
      as a named table
    * Support for PostgreSQL's special "derived column" syntax that includes
      column names and sometimes datatypes, such as for the
      ``json_to_recordset`` function, using the
      :meth:`_sql.TableValuedAlias.render_derived` method.
    * Support for PostgreSQL's "WITH ORDINALITY" construct using the
      :paramref:`_functions.FunctionElement.table_valued.with_ordinality` parameter
    * Support for selection FROM a SQL function as column-valued scalar, a
      syntax supported by PostgreSQL and Oracle, via the
      :meth:`_functions.FunctionElement.column_valued` method
    * A way to SELECT a single column from a table-valued expression without
      using a FROM clause via the :meth:`_functions.FunctionElement.scalar_table_valued`
      method.
