    :tickets: 6963

    Fixed issue where an engine that had
    :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.implicit_returning` set to False would fail to
    function when PostgreSQL's "fast insertmany" feature were used in
    conjunction with a ``Sequence``, as well as if any kind of "executemany"
    with "return_defaults()" were used in conjunction with a ``Sequence``. Note
    that PostgreSQL "fast insertmany" uses "RETURNING" by definition, when the
    SQL statement is passed to the driver; overall, the
    :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.implicit_returning` flag is legacy and has no
    real use in modern SQLAlchemy, and will be deprecated in a separate change.
