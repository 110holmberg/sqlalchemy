    Fixed issue where calling upon :meth:`_orm.registry.map_imperatively` more
    than once for the same class would produce an unexpected error, rather than
    an informative error that the target class is already mapped. This behavior
    differed from that of the :func:`_orm.mapper` function which does report an
    informative message already.
