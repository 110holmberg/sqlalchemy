    The :class:`.TypeDecorator` class will now emit a warning when used in SQL
    compilation with caching unless the ``.cache_ok`` flag is set to ``True``
    or ``False``. A new class-level attribute :attr:`.TypeDecorator.cache_ok`
    may be set which will be used as an indication that all the parameters
    passed to the object are safe to be used as a cache key if set to ``True``,
    ``False`` means they are not.
