    Fixed issue where the ``__class_getitem__()`` method of the generated
    declarative base class by :func:`_orm.as_declarative` would lead to
    inaccessible class attributes such as ``__table__``, for cases where a
    ``Generic[T]`` style typing declaration were used in the class hierarchy.
    This is in continuation from the basic addition of ``__class_getitem__()``
    in :ticket:`7368`. Pull request courtesy Kai Mueller.
