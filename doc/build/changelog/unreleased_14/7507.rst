    Fixed issue in joined-inheritance load of additional attributes
    functionality in deep multi-level inheritance where an intermediary table
    that contained no columns would not be included in the tables joined,
    instead linking those tables to their primary key identifiers. While this
    works fine, it nonetheless in 1.4 began producing the cartesian product
    compiler warning. The logic has been changed so that these intermediary
    tables are included regardless. While this does include additional tables
    in the query that are not technically necessary, this only occurs for the
    highly unusual case of deep 3+ level inheritance with intermediary tables
    that have no non primary key columns, potential performance impact is
    therefore expected to be negligible.
