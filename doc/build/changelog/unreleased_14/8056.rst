    Fixed bug, likely a regression from 1.3, where usage of column names that
    require bound parameter escaping, more concretely when using Oracle with
    column names that require quoting such as those that start with an
    underscore, or in less common cases with some PostgreSQL drivers when using
    column names that contain percent signs, would cause the ORM versioning
    feature to not work correctly if the versioning column itself had such a
    name, as the ORM assumes certain bound parameter naming conventions that
    were being interfered with via the quotes. This issue is related to
    :ticket:`8053` and essentially revises the approach towards fixing this,
    revising the original issue :ticket:`5653` that created the initial
    implementation for generalized bound-parameter name quoting.
