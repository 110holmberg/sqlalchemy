    Improvements in memory usage by the ORM, removing a significant set of
    intermediary expression objects that are typically stored when a copy of an
    expression object is created. These clones have been greatly reduced,
    reducing the number of total expression objects stored in memory by
    ORM mappings by about 30%.
