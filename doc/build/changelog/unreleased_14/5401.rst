    The psycopg2 dialect now defaults to using the very performant
    ``execute_values()`` psycopg2 extension for compiled INSERT statements,
    and also implements RETURNING support when this extension is used.  This
    allows INSERT statements that even include an autoincremented SERIAL
    or IDENTITY value to run very fast while still being able to return the
    newly generated primary key values.   The ORM will then integrate this
    new feature in a separate change.
