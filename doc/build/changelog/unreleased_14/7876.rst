    The :paramref:`.bindparam.literal_execute` parameter now takes part
    of the cache generation of a :func:`.bindparam`, since it changes
    the sql string generated by the compiler.
    Previously the correct bind values were used, but the ``literal_execute``
    would be ignored on subsequent executions of the same query.
