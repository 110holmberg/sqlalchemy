    Fixed critical regression caused by the new feature added as part of
    :ticket:`1763`, eager loaders are invoked on unexpire operations. The new
    feature makes use of the "immediateload" eager loader strategy as a
    substitute for a collection loading strategy, which unlike the other
    "post-load" strategies was not accommodating for recursive invocations
    between mutually-dependent relationships, leading to recursion overflow
    errors.
