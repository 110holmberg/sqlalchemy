    Fixed regression caused by :ticket:`5395` where tuning back the check for
    sequences in :func:`_sql.select` now caused failures when doing 2.0-style
    querying with a mapped class that also happens to have an ``__iter__()``
    method. Tuned the check some more to accommodate this as well as some other
    interesting ``__iter__()`` scenarios.
