    Added a new flag to the :class:`_engine.Dialect` class called
    :attr:`_engine.Dialect.supports_statement_cache`. This flag now needs to be present
    directly on a dialect class in order for SQLAlchemy's
    :ref:`query cache <sql_caching>` to take effect for that dialect. The
    rationale is based on discovered issues such as :ticket:`6173` revealing
    that dialects which hardcode literal values from the compiled statement,
    often the numerical parameters used for LIMIT / OFFSET, will not be
    compatible with caching until these dialects are revised to use the
    parameters present in the statement only. For third party dialects where
    this flag is not applied, the SQL logging will show the message "dialect
    does not support caching", indicating the dialect should seek to apply this
    flag once they have verified that no per-statement literal values are being
    rendered within the compilation phase.
