    Fixed issue in new 1.4/2.0 style ORM queries where a statement-level label
    style would not be preserved in the keys used by result rows; this has been
    applied to all combinations of Core/ORM columns / session vs. connection
    etc. so that the linkage from statement to result row is the same in all
    cases.   As part of this change, the labeling of column expressions
    in rows has been improved to retain the original name of the ORM
    attribute even if used in a subquery.
