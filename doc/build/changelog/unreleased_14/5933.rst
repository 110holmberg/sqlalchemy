    Fixed issue in new 1.4/2.0 style ORM queries where a statement-level label
    style would not be preserved in the keys used by result rows; this has been
    applied to all combinations of Core/ORM columns / session vs. connection
    etc. so that the linkage from statement to result row is the same in all
    cases.
