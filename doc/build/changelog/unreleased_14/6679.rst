    Fixed regression in :mod:`sqlalchemy.ext.automap` extension such that the
    use case of creating an explicit mapped class to a table that is also the
    :paramref:`_orm.relationship.secondary` element of a
    :func:`_orm.relationship` that automap will be generating would emit the
    "overlaps" warnings introduced in 1.4 and discussed at :ref:`error_qzyx`.
    While generating this case from automap is still subject to the same
    caveats that the "overlaps" warning refers towards, as automap is intended
    for more ad-hoc use cases, the condition which produces the warning is
    disabled when a many-to-many relationship with this particular pattern is
    generated.
