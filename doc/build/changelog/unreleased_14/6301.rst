    :ticketS: 6301

    Altered some of the behavior repaired in :ticket:`6232` where the
    ``immediateload`` loader strategy no longer goes into recursive loops; the
    modification is that an eager load (joinedload, selectinload, or
    subqueryload) from A->bs->B which then states ``immediateload`` for a
    simple manytoone B->a->A that's in the identity map will populate the B->A,
    so that this attribute is back-populated when the collection of A/A.bs are
    loaded. This allows the objects to be functional when detached.
