    Fixed ORM unit of work regression where an errant "assert primary_key"
    statement interferes with primary key generation sequences that don't
    actually consider the columns in the table to use a real primary key
    constraint, instead using :paramref:`_orm.mapper.primary_key` to establish
    certain columns as "primary".
