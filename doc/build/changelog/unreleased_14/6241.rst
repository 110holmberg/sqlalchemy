    A new approach has been applied to the warnings system in SQLAlchemy to
    accurately predict the appropriate stack level for each warning
    dynamically. This allows evaluating the source of SQLAlchemy-generated
    warnings and deprecation warnings to be more straightforward as the warning
    will indicate the source line within end-user code, rather than from an
    arbitrary level within SQLAlchemy's own source code.
