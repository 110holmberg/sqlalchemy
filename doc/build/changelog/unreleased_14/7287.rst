    Fixed regression where the :func:`_sql.text` construct would no longer be
    accepted as a target case in the "whens" list within a :func:`_sql.case`
    construct. The regression appears related to an attempt to guard against
    some forms of literal values that were considered to be ambiguous when
    passed here; however, there's no reason the target cases shouldn't be
    interpreted as open-ended SQL expressions just like anywhere else, and a
    literal string or tuple will be converted to a bound parameter as would be
    the case elsewhere.
