    The ORM bulk update and delete operations, historically available via the
    :meth:`_orm.Query.update` and :meth:`_orm.Query.delete` methods as well as
    via the :class:`_dml.Update` and :class:`_dml.Delete` constructs for
    :term:`2.0 style` execution, will now automatically accommodate for the
    additional WHERE criteria needed for a single-table inheritance
    discriminator in order to limit the statement to rows referring to the
    specific subtype requested.   The new :func:`_orm.with_loader_criteria`
    construct is also supported for with bulk update/delete operations.
