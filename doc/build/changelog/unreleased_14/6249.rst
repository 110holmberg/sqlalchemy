    Fixed regression where the :class:`_sql.BindParameter` object would not
    properly render for an IN expression (i.e. using the "post compile" feature
    in 1.4) if the object were copied from either an internal cloning
    operation, or from a pickle operation, and the parameter name contained
    spaces or other special characters.
