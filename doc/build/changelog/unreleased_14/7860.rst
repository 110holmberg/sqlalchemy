    Added support so that the :paramref:`.Table.to_metadata.referred_schema_fn`
    callable passed to :meth:`.Table.to_metadata` may return the value
    :attr:`.BLANK_SCHEMA` to indicate that the referenced foreign key should be
    reset to None. The :attr:`RETAIN_SCHEMA` symbol may also be returned from
    this function to indicate "no change", which will behave the same as
    ``None`` currently does which also indicates no change.
