    The "skip_locked" keyword used with ``with_for_update()`` will render "SKIP
    LOCKED" on all MySQL backends, meaning it will fail for MySQL less than
    version 8 and on current MariaDB backends.  This is because those backends
    do not support "SKIP LOCKED" or any equivalent, so this error should not be
    silently ignored.   This is upgraded from a warning in the 1.3 series.
