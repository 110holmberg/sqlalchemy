    Fixed regression where the ORM compilation scheme would assume the function
    name of a hybrid property would be the same as the attribute name in such a
    way that an ``AttributeError`` would be raised, when it would attempt to
    determine the correct name for each element in a result tuple. A similar
    issue exists in 1.3 but only impacts the names of tuple rows. The fix here
    adds a check that the hybrid's function name is actually present in the
    ``__dict__`` of the class or its superclasses before assigning this name;
    otherwise, the hybrid is considered to be "unnamed" and ORM result tuples
    will use the naming scheme of the underlying expression.
