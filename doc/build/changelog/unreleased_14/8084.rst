    Enhanced the mechanism of :class:`.Cast` and other "wrapping"
    column constructs to more fully preserve a wrapped :class:`.Label`
    construct, including that the label name will be preserved in the
    ``.c`` collection of a :class:`.Subquery`.  The label was already
    able to render in the SQL correctly on the outside of the construct
    which it was wrapped inside.
