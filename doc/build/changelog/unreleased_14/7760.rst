    Fixed issue where the :meth:`.HasCTE.add_cte` method as called upon a
    :class:`.TextualSelect` instance was not being accommodated by the SQL
    compiler. The fix additionally adds more "SELECT"-like compiler behavior to
    :class:`.TextualSelect` including that DML CTEs such as UPDATE and INSERT
    may be accommodated.
