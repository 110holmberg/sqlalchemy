    Fixed issue where passing ``None`` for the value of
    :paramref:`_schema.Table.prefixes` would not store an empty list, but
    rather the constant ``None``, which may be unexpected by third party
    dialects. The issue is revealed by a usage in recent versions of Alembic
    that are passing ``None`` for this value. Pull request courtesy Kai
    Mueller.
