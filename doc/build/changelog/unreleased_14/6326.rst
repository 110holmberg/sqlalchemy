    Fixed additional regression caused by the "eagerloaders on refresh" feature
    added in :ticket:`1763` where the refresh operation historically would set
    ``populate_existing``, which given the new feature now overwrites pending
    changes on eagerly loaded objects when autoflush is false. The
    populate_existing flag has been turned off for this case and a more
    specific method used to ensure the correct attributes refreshed.
