    The setup requirements have been modified such ``greenlet`` is a default
    requirement only for those platforms that are well known for ``greenlet``
    to be installable and for which there is already a pre-built binary on
    pypi; the current list is ``x86_64 aarch64 ppc64le amd64 win32``. For other
    platforms, greenlet will not install by default, which should enable
    installation and test suite running of SQLAlchemy 1.4 on platforms that
    don't support ``greenlet``, excluding any asyncio features. In order to
    install with the ``greenlet`` dependency included on a machine architecture
    outside of the above list, the ``[asyncio]`` extra may be included by
    running ``pip install sqlalchemy[asyncio]`` which will then attempt to
    install ``greenlet``.

    Additionally, the test suite has been repaired so that tests can complete
    fully when greenlet is not installed, with appropriate skips for
    asyncio-related tests.
