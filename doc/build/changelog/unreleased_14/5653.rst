    Improved support for column names that contain percent signs in the string,
    including repaired issues involving anoymous labels that also embedded a
    column name with a percent sign in it, as well as re-established support
    for bound parameter names with percent signs embedded on the psycopg2
    dialect, using a late-escaping process similar to that used by the
    cx_Oracle dialect.
