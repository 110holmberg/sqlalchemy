    Scaled back a fix made for :ticket:`6581` where "executemany values" mode
    for psycopg2 were disabled for all "ON CONFLICT" styles of INSERT, to
    not apply to the "ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING" clause, which does not include
    any parameters and is safe for "executemany values" mode.  "ON CONFLICT
    DO UPDATE" is still blocked from "executemany values" as there may
    be additional parameters in the DO UPDATE clause that cannot be batched
    (which is the original issue fixed by :ticket:`6581`).
