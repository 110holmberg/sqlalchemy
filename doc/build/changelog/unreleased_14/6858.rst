    Fixed an issue in the ``CacheKey.to_offline_string()`` method used by the
    dogpile.caching example where attempting to create a proper cache key from
    the special "lambda" query generated by the lazy loader would fail to
    include the parameter values, leading to an incorrect cache key.
