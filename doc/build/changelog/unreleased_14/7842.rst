    Fixed issue where the :class:`_orm.Mapper` would reduce a user-defined
    :paramref:`_orm.Mapper.primary_key` argument too aggressively, in the case
    of mapping to a ``UNION`` where for some of the SELECT entries, two columns
    are essentially equivalent, but in another, they are not, such as in a
    recursive CTE. The logic here has been changed to accept a given
    user-defined PK as given, where columns will be related to the mapped
    selectable but no longer "reduced" as this heuristic can't accommodate for
    all situations.
