    Fixed regression caused by :ticket:`8064` where a particular check for
    column correspondence was made too liberal, resulting in incorrect
    rendering for some ORM subqueries such as those using
    :meth:`.PropComparator.has` or :meth:`.PropComparator.any` in conjunction
    with joined-inheritance queries that also use legacy aliasing features.
