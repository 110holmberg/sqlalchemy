    Rudimentary and experimental support for Mypy has been added in the form of
    a new plugin, which itself depends on new typing stubs for SQLAlchemy. The
    plugin allows declarative mappings in their standard form to both be
    compatible with Mypy as well as to provide typing support for mapped
    classes and instances.
