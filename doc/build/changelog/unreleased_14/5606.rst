    The "slice index" feature used by :class:`_orm.Query` as well as by the
    dynamic relationship loader will no longer accept negative indexes in
    SQLAlchemy 2.0.  These operations do not work efficiently and load the
    entire collection in, which is both surprising and undesirable.   These
    will warn in 1.4 unless the :paramref:`_orm.Session.future` flag is set in
    which case they will raise IndexError.
