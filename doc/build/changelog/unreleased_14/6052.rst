    Fixed regression where calling upon :meth:`_orm.Query.count` in conjunction
    with a loader option such as :func:`_orm.joinedload` would fail to ignore
    the loader option. This is a behavior that has always been very specific to
    the :meth:`_orm.Query.count` method; an error is normally raised if a given
    :class:`_orm.Query` has options that don't apply to what it is returning.
