    Fixed SQL compiler issue where the "bind processing" function for a bound
    parameter would not be correctly applied to a bound value if the bound
    parameter's name were "escaped". Concretely, this applies, among other
    cases, to Oracle when a :class:`.Column` has a name that itself requires
    quoting, such that the quoting-required name is then used for the bound
    parameters generated within DML statements, and the datatype in use
    requires bind processing, such as the :class:`.Enum` datatype.
