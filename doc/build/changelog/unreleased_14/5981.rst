    Fixed regression where the :paramref:`_orm.relationship.query_class`
    parameter stopped being functional for "dynamic" relationships.  The
    ``AppenderQuery`` remains dependent on the legacy :class:`_orm.Query`
    class; users are encouraged to migrate from the use of "dynamic"
    relationships to using :func:`_orm.with_parent` instead.
