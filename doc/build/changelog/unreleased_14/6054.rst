    Fixed bug where user-mapped classes that contained an attribute named
    "registry" would cause conflicts with the new registry-based mapping system
    when using :class:`.DeclarativeMeta`. While the attribute remains
    something that can be set explicitly on a declarative base to be
    consumed by the metaclass, once located it is placed under a private
    class variable so it does not conflict with future subclasses that use
    the same name for other purposes.
