    :tickets: 6008

    Fixed regression where usage of the standalone :func:`_sql.distinct()` used
    in the form of being directly SELECTed would fail to be locatable in the
    result set by column identity, which is how the ORM locates columns. While
    standalone :func:`_sql.distinct()` is not oriented towards being directly
    SELECTed (use :meth:`_sql.select.distinct` for a regular
    ``SELECT DISTINCT..``) , it was usable to a limited extent in this way
    previously (but wouldn't work in subqueries, for example). The column
    targeting for unary expressions such as "DISTINCT <col>" has been improved
    so that this case works again, and an additional improvement has been made
    so that usage of this form in a subquery at least generates valid SQL which
    was not the case previously.

    The change additionally enhances the ability to target elements in
    ``row._mapping`` based on SQL expression objects in ORM-enabled
    SELECT statements, including whether the statement was invoked by
    ``connection.execute()`` or ``session.execute()``.
