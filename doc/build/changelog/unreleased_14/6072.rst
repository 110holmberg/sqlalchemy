    Clarified the current purpose of the
    :paramref:`_orm.relationship.bake_queries` flag, which in 1.4 is to enable
    or disable "lambda caching" of statements within the "lazyload" and
    "selectinload" loader strategies; this is separate from the more
    foundational SQL query cache that is used for most statements.
    Additionally, the lazy loader no longer uses its own cache for many-to-one
    SQL queries, which was an implementation quirk that doesn't exist for any
    other loader scenario. Finally, the "lru cache" warning that the lazyloader
    and selectinloader strategies could emit when handling a wide array of
    class/relationship combinations has been removed; based on analysis of some
    end-user cases, this warning doesn't suggest any significant issue. While
    setting ``bake_queries=False`` for such a relationship will remove this
    cache from being used, there's no particular performance gain in this case
    as using no caching vs. using a cache that needs to refresh often likely
    still wins out on the caching being used side.
