    Fixed issue where SQLite unique constraint reflection would not work
    for an inline UNIQUE constraint where the column name had an underscore
    in its name.

.. change::
    :tags: usecase, sqlite
    :tickets: 7736

    Added support for reflecting SQLite inline unique constraints where
    the column names are formatted with SQLite "escape quotes" ``[]``
    or `` ` ``, which are discarded by the database when producing the
    column name.
