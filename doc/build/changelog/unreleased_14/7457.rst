    Corrected the error classes inspected for the "is_disconnect" check for the
    ``mariadbconnector`` dialect, which was failing for disconnects that
    occurred due to common MySQL/MariaDB error codes such as 2006; the DBAPI
    appears to currently use the ``mariadb.InterfaceError`` exception class for
    disconnect errors such as error code 2006, which has been added to the list
    of classes checked.
