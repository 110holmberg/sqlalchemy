    Repaired the ``pysqlcipher`` dialect to connect correctly which had
    regressed in 1.4, and added test + CI support to maintain the driver
    in working condition.  The dialect now imports the ``sqlcipher3`` module
    for Python 3 by default before falling back to ``pysqlcipher3`` which
    is documented as now being unmaintained.
