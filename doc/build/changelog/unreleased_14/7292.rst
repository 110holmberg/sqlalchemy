    Fixed regression where the row objects returned for ORM queries, which are
    now the normal :class:`_sql.Row` objects, would not be interpreted by the
    :meth:`_sql.ColumnOperators.in_` operator as tuple values to be broken out
    into individual bound parameters, and would instead pass them as single
    values to the driver leading to failures. The change to the "expanding IN"
    system now accommodates for the expression already being of type
    :class:`.TupleType` and treats values accordingly if so. In the uncommon
    case of using "tuple-in" with an untyped statement such as a textual
    statement with no typing information, a tuple value is detected for values
    that implement ``collections.abc.Sequence``, but that are not ``str`` or
    ``bytes``, as always when testing for ``Sequence``.

    Added :class:`.TupleType` to the top level ``sqlalchemy`` import namespace.
