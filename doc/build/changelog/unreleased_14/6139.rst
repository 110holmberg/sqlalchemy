    Fixed critical issue in the new :meth:`_orm.PropComparator.and_` feature
    where loader strategies that emit secondary SELECT statements such as
    :func:`_orm.selectinload` and :func:`_orm.lazyload` would fail to
    accommodate for bound parameters in the user-defined criteria in terms of
    the current statement being executed, as opposed to the cached statement,
    causing stale bound values to be used.

    This also adds a warning for the case where an object that uses
    :func:`_orm.lazyload` in conjunction with :meth:`_orm.PropComparator.and_`
    is attempted to be serialized; the loader criteria cannot reliably
    be serialized and deserialized and eager loading should be used for this
    case.
