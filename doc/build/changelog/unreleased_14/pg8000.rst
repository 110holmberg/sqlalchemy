    The pg8000 dialect has been revised and modernized for the most recent
    version of the pg8000 driver for PostgreSQL.  Changes to the dialect
    include:

    * All data types are now sent as text rather than binary.

    * Using adapters, custom types can be plugged in to pg8000.

    * Previously, named prepared statements were used for all statements.
      Now unnamed prepared statements are used by default, and named
      prepared statements can be used explicitly by calling the
      Connection.prepare() method, which returns a PreparedStatement
      object.
