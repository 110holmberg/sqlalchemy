	Fixed bug in lambda SQL feature, used by ORM
	:meth:`_orm.with_loader_criteria` as well as available generally in the SQL
	expression language, where assigning a boolean value True/False to a
	variable would cause the query-time expression calculation to fail, as it
	would produce a SQL expression not compatible with a bound value.
