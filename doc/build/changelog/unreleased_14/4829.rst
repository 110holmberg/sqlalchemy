    Added new entity-targeting capabilities to the ORM query context
    help with the case where the :class:`.Session` is using a bind dictionary
    against mapped classes, rather than a single bind, and the :class:`_query.Query`
    is against a Core statement that was ultimately generated from a method
    such as :meth:`_query.Query.subquery`.  First implemented using a deep
    search, the current approach leverages the unified :func:`_sql.select`
    construct to keep track of the first mapper that is part of
    the construct.
