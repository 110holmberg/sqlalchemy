    Fixed regression involving clause adaption of labeled ORM compound
    elements, such as single-table inheritance discriminator expressions with
    conditionals or CASE expressions, which could cause aliased expressions
    such as those used in ORM join / joinedload operations to not be adapted
    correctly, such as referring to the wrong table in the ON clause in a join.

    This change also improves a performance bump that was located within the
    process of invoking :meth:`_sql.Select.join` given an ORM attribute
    as a target.
