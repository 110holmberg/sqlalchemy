    The ORM Declarative system is now unified into the ORM itself, with new
    import spaces under ``sqlalchemy.orm`` and new kinds of mappings.  Support
    for decorator-based mappings without using a base class, support for
    classical style-mapper() calls that have access to the declarative class
    registry for relationships, and full integration of Declarative with 3rd
    party class attribute systems like ``dataclasses`` and ``attrs`` is now
    supported.
