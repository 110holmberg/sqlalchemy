    Fixed a critical regression in the relationship lazy loader where the SQL
    criteria used to fetch a related many-to-one object could go stale in
    relation to other memoized structures within the loader if the mapper had
    configuration changes, such as can occur when mappers are late configured
    or configured on demand, producing a comparison to None and returning no
    object. Huge thanks to Alan Hamlett for their help tracking this down late
    into the night.
