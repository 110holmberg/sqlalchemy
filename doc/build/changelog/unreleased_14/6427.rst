    Established a deprecation path for calling upon the
    :meth:`_cursor.CursorResult.keys` method for a statement that returns no
    rows to provide support for legacy patterns used by the "records" package
    as well as any other non-migrated applications. Previously, this would
    raise :class:`.ResourceClosedException` unconditionally in the same way as
    it does when attempting to fetch rows. While this is the correct behavior
    going forward, the :class:`_cursor.LegacyCursorResult` object will now in
    this case return an empty list for ``.keys()`` as it did in 1.3, while also
    emitting a 2.0 deprecation warning. The :class:`_cursor.CursorResult`, used
    when using a 2.0-style "future" engine, will continue to raise as it does
    now.
