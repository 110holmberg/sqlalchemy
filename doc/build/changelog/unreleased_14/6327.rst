    Fixed issue in SQL compiler where the bound parameters set up for a
    :class:`.Values` construct wouldn't be positionally tracked correctly if
    inside of a :class:`_sql.CTE`, affecting database drivers that support
    VALUES + ctes and use positional parameters such as SQL Server in
    particular as well as asyncpg.   The fix also repairs support for
    compiler flags such as ``literal_binds``.
