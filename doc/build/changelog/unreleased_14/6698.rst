    Fixed regression caused in 1.4.19 due to #6503 and related involving
    :meth:`_orm.Query.with_entities` where the new structure used would be
    inappropriately transferred to an enclosing :class:`_orm.Query` when making
    use of set operations such as :meth:`_orm.Query.union`, causing the JOIN
    instructions within to be applied to the outside query as well.
