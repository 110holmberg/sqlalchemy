    Further clarified connection-level logging to indicate the BEGIN, ROLLBACK
    and COMMIT log messages do not actually indicate a real transaction when
    the AUTOCOMMIT isolation level is in use; messaging has been extended to
    include the BEGIN message itself, and the messaging has also been fixed to
    accommodate when the :class:`.Engine` level
    :paramref:`.create_engine.isolation_level` parameter was used directly.
