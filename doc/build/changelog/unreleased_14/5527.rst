    Added support for reflecting "identity" columns, which are now returned
    as part of the structure returned by :meth:`_reflection.Inspector.get_columns`.
    When reflecting full :class:`_schema.Table` objects, identity columns will
    be represented using the :class:`_schema.Identity` construct.
    Currently the supported backends are
    PostgreSQL >= 10, Oracle >= 12 and MSSQL (with different syntax
    and a subset of functionalities).
