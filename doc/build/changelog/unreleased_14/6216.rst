    Fixed regression where usage of a token in the
    :paramref:`_engine.Connection.execution_options.schema_translate_map`
    dictionary which contained special characters such as braces would fail to
    be substituted properly. Use of square bracket characters ``[]`` is now
    explicitly disallowed as these are used as a delimiter character in the
    current implementation.
