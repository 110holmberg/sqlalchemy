    Fixed an additional regression in the same area as that of :ticket:`6173`,
    :ticket:`6184`, where using a value of 0 for OFFSET in conjunction with
    LIMIT with SQL Server would create a statement using "TOP", as was the
    behavior in 1.3, however due to caching would then fail to respond
    accordingly to other values of OFFSET. If the "0" wasn't first, then it
    would be fine. For the fix, the "TOP" syntax is now only emitted if the
    OFFSET value is omitted entirely, that is, :meth:`_sql.Select.offset` is
    not used. Note that this change now requires that if the "with_ties" or
    "percent" modifiers are used, the statement can't specify an OFFSET of
    zero, it now needs to be omitted entirely.
