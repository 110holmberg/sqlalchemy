    Adjusted the check in the mapper for a callable object that is used as a
    ``@validates`` validator function or a ``@reconstructor`` reconstruction
    function, to check for "callable" more liberally such as to accommodate
    objects based on fundamental attributes like ``__func__`` and
    ``__call___``, rather than testing for ``MethodType`` / ``FunctionType``,
    allowing things like cython functions to work properly. Pull request
