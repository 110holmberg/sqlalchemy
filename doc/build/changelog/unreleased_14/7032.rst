    Added an informative error message when a method object is passed to a SQL
    construct. Previously, when such a callable were passed, as is a common
    typographical error when dealing with method-chained SQL constructs, they
    were interpreted as "lambda SQL" targets to be invoked at compilation time,
    which would lead to silent failures. As this feature was not intended to be
    used with methods, method objects are now rejected.
