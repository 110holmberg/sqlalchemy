    MySQL dialect's server_version_info tuple is now all numeric.  String
    tokens like "MariaDB" are no longer present so that numeric comparison
    works in all cases.  The .is_mariadb flag on the dialect should be
    consulted for whether or not mariadb was detected.   Additionally removed
    structures meant to support extremely old MySQL versions 3.x and 4.x;
    the minimum MySQL version supported is now version 5.0.2.
