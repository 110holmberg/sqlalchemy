    Fixed multiple observed race conditions related to :func:`.lambda_stmt`,
    including an initial "dogpile" issue when a new Python code object is
    initially analyzed among multiple simultaneous threads which created both a
    performance issue as well as some internal corruption of state.
    Additionally repaired observed race condition which could occur when
    "cloning" an expression construct that is also in the process of being
    compiled or otherwise accessed in a different thread due to memoized
    attributes altering the ``__dict__`` while iterated, for Python versions
    prior to 3.10; in particular the lambda SQL construct is sensitive to this
    as it holds onto a single statement object persistently. The iteration has
    been refined to use ``dict.copy()`` with or without an additional iteration
    instead.
