    Enhanced the bind resolution rules for :meth:`_orm.Session.execute` so that
    when a non-ORM statement such as an :func:`_sql.insert` construct
    nonetheless is built against ORM objects, to the greatest degree possible
    the ORM entity will be used to resolve the bind, such as for a
    :class:`_orm.Session` that has a bind map set up on a common superclass
    without specific mappers or tables named in the map.
