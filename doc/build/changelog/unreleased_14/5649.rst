    Reworked the "setinputsizes()" set of dialect hooks to be correctly
    extensible for any arbirary DBAPI, by allowing dialects individual hooks
    that may invoke cursor.setinputsizes() in the appropriate style for that
    DBAPI.   In particular this is intended to support pyodbc's style of usage
    which is fundamentally different from that of cx_Oracle.  Added support
    for pyodbc.
