    :tags: bug, engine, sqlite
    :tickets: 5845

    Fixed bug in the 2.0 "future" version of :class:`.Engine` where emitting
    SQL during the :meth:`.EngineEvents.begin` event hook would cause a
    re-entrant (recursive) condition due to autobegin, affecting among other
    things the recipe documented for SQLite to allow for savepoints and
    serializable isolation support.


.. change::
    :tags: bug, orm, regression
    :tickets: 5845

    Fixed issue in new :class:`_orm.Session` similar to that of the
    :class:`_engine.Connection` where the new "autobegin" logic could be
    tripped into a re-entrant (recursive) state if SQL were executed within the
    :meth:`.SessionEvents.after_transaction_create` event hook.
