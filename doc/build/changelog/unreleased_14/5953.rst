    Deprecated all schema-level ``.copy()`` methods and renamed to
    ``_copy()``.  These are not standard Python "copy()" methods as they
    typically rely upon being instantiated within particular contexts
    which are passed to the method as optional keyword arguments.   The
    :meth:`_schema.Table.tometadata` method is the public API that provides
    copying for :class:`_schema.Table` objects.
