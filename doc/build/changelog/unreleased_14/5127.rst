    Improved the :func:`_sql.tuple_` construct such that it behaves predictably
    when used in a columns-clause context.  The SQL tuple is not supported as a
    "SELECT" columns clause element on most backends; on those that do
    (PostgreSQL, not surprisingly), the Python DBAPI does not have a "nested
    type" concept so there are still challenges in fetching rows for such an
    object. Use of :func:`_sql.tuple_` in a :func:`_sql.select` or
    :class:`_orm.Query` will now raise a :class:`_exc.CompileError` at the
    point at which the :func:`_sql.tuple_` object is seen as presenting itself
    for fetching rows (i.e., if the tuple is in the columns clause of a
    subquery, no error is raised).  For ORM use,the :class:`_orm.Bundle` object
    is an explicit directive that a series of columns should be returned as a
    sub-tuple per row and is suggested by the error message. Additionally ,the
    tuple will now render with parenthesis in all contexts. Previously, the
    parenthesization would not render in a columns context leading to
    non-defined behavior.
