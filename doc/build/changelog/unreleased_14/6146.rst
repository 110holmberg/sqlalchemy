    Introduce a new parameter :paramref:`_types.Enum.omit_aliases` in
    :class:`_types.Enum` type allow filtering aliases when using a pep435 Enum.
    Previous versions of SQLAlchemy kept aliases in all cases, creating
    database enum type with additional states, meaning that they were treated
    as different values in the db. For backward compatibility this flag
    defaults to ``False`` in the 1.4 series, but will be switched to ``True``
    in a future version. A deprecation warning is raise if this flag is not
    specified and the passed enum contains aliases.
