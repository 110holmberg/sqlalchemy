    Fixed bug where :class:`.ForeignKeyConstraint` naming conventions using the
    ``referred_column_0`` naming convention key would not work if the foreign
    key constraint were set up as a :class:`.ForeignKey` object rather than an
    explicit :class:`.ForeignKeyConstraint` object. As this change makes use of
    a backport of some fixes from version 2.0, an additional little-known
    feature that has likely been broken for many years is also fixed which is
    that a :class:`.ForeignKey` object may refer to a referred table by name of
    the table alone without using a column name, if the name of the referent
    column is the same as that of the referred column.

    The ``referred_column_0`` naming convention key was previously not tested
    with the :class:`.ForeignKey` object, only :class:`.ForeignKeyConstraint`,
    and this bug reveals that the feature has never worked correctly unless
    :class:`.ForeignKeyConstraint` is used for all FK constraints. This bug
    traces back to the original introduction of the feature introduced for
    :ticket:`3989`.
