    Made a small adjustment in the table reflection feature of the MySQL
    dialect to accommodate for alternate MySQL-oriented databases such as TiDB
    which include their own "comment" directives at the end of a constraint
    directive within "CREATE TABLE" where the format doesn't have the
    additional space character after the comment, in this case the TiDB
    "clustered index" feature. Pull request courtesy DaniÃ«l van Eeden.
