    Fixed regression where the introduction of the INSERT syntax "INSERT...
    VALUES (DEFAULT)" was not supported on some backends that do however
    support "INSERT..DEFAULT VALUES", including SQLite. The two syntaxes are
    now each individually supported or non-supported for each dialect, for
    example MySQL supports "VALUES (DEFAULT)" but not "DEFAULT VALUES".
    Support for Oracle has also been enabled.
