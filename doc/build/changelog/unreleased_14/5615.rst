  Adjusted the greenlet integration, which provides support for Python asyncio
  in SQLAlchemy, to accommodate for the handling of Python ``contextvars``
  (introduced in Python 3.7) for ``greenlet`` versions greater than 0.4.17.
  Greenlet version 0.4.17 added automatic handling of contextvars in a
  backwards-incompatible way; we've coordinated with the greenlet authors to
  add a preferred API for this in versions subsequent to 0.4.17 which is now
  supported by SQLAlchemy's greenlet integration.  For greenlet versions prior
  to 0.4.17 no behavioral change is needed, version 0.4.17 itself is blocked
  from the dependencies.
