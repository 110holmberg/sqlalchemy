    Modified the asyncpg dialect to gracefully degrade types that are
    not supported by PostgreSQL work-alike databases. For example,
    CockroachDB supports JSONB but not JSON. Third-party dialects that
    are derived from ``PGDialect_asyncpg`` will no longer have to
    work around ValueError being raised by trying to register a codec
    for an unsupported type.
