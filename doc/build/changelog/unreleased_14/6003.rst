    Fixed regression where :meth:`_orm.Query.join` would produce no effect if
    the query itself as well as the join target were against a
    :class:`_schema.Table` object, rather than a mapped class. This was part of
    a more systemic issue where the legacy ORM query compiler would not be
    correctly used from a :class:`_orm.Query` if the statement produced had not
    ORM entities present within it.
