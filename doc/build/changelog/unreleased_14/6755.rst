    Fixed issue in :meth:`_postgresql.Insert.on_conflict_do_nothing` and
    :meth:`_postgresql.Insert.on_conflict_do_update` where the name of a unique
    constraint passed as the ``constraint`` parameter would not be properly
    truncated for length if it were based on a naming convention that generated
    a too-long name for the PostgreSQL max identifier length of 63 characters,
    in the same way which occurs within a CREATE TABLE statement.
