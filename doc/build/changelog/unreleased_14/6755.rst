    Fixed issue where a too-long constraint name rendered as part of the "ON
    CONFLICT ON CONSTRAINT" element of the :class:`_postgresql.Insert`
    construct due to naming convention generation would not correctly truncate
    the name in the same way that it normally renders within a CREATE TABLE
    statement, thus producing a non-matching and too-long constraint name.
