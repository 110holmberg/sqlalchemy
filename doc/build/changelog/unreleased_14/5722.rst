    Established support for :class:`_schema.Column` objects as well as ORM
    instrumented attributes as keys in the ``set_`` dictionary passed to the
    :meth:`_postgresql.Insert.on_conflict_do_update` and
    :meth:`_sqlite.Insert.on_conflict_do_update` methods, which match to the
    :class:`_schema.Column` objects in the ``.c`` collection of the target
    :class:`_schema.Table`. Previously,  only string column names were
    expected; a column expression would be assumed to be an out-of-table
    expression that would render fully along with a warning.
