    Fixed issue where mypy plugin would not correctly interpret an explicit
    :class:`_orm.Mapped` annotation in conjunction with a
    :func:`_orm.relationship` that refers to a class by string name; the
    correct annotation would be downgraded to a less specific one leading to
    typing errors.
