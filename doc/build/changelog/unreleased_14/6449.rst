    Fixed additional regression caused by "eager loaders run on unexpire"
    feature :ticket:`1763` where the feature would run for a
    ``contains_eager()`` eagerload option in the case that the
    ``contains_eager()`` were chained to an additional eager loader option,
    which would then produce an incorrect query as the original query-bound
    join criteria were no longer present.
