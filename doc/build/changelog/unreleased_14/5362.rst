    Added the :class:`_schema.Identity` construct that can be used to
    configure identity columns rendered with GENERATED { ALWAYS |
    BY DEFAULT } AS IDENTITY. Currently the supported backends are
    PostgreSQL >= 10, Oracle >= 12 and MSSQL (with different syntax
    and a subset of functionalities).
