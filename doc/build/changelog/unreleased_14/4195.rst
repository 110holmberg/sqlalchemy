    Fixed bug in ORM versioning feature where assignment of an explicit
    version_id for a counter configured against a mapped selectable where
    version_id_col is against the underlying table would fail if the previous
    value were expired; this was due to the fact that the  mapped attribute
    would not be configured with active_history=True.
