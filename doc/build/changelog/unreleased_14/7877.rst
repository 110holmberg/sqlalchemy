    Added new parameter :paramref:`.Engine.dispose.close`, defaulting to True.
    When False, the engine disposal does not touch the connections in the old
    pool at all, simply dropping the pool and replacing it. This use case is so
    that when the original pool is transferred from a parent process, the
    parent process may continue to use those connections.
