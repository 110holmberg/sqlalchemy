    Fixed regression where use of an arbitrary iterable with the
    :func:`_sql.select` function was not working, outside of plain lists. The
    forwards/backwards compatibility logic here now checks for a wider range of
    incoming "iterable" types including that a ``.c`` collection from a
    selectable can be passed directly. Pull request compliments of Oliver Rice.
