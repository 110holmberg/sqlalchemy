    Fixed bug involving :class:`.Select` constructs, where combinations of
    :meth:`.Select.select_from` with :meth:`.Select.join`, as well as when
    using :meth:`.Select.join_from`, would cause the
    :func:`_orm.with_loader_criteria` feature as well as the IN criteria needed
    for single-table inheritance queries to not render, in cases where the
    columns clause of the query did not explicitly include the left-hand side
    entity of the JOIN. The correct entity is now transferred to the
    :class:`.Join` object that's generated internally, so that the criteria
    against the left side entity is correctly added.
