    The :func:`_expression.select` construct is moving towards a new calling
    form that is ``select(col1, col2, col3, ..)``, with all other keyword
    arguments removed, as these are all suited using generative methods.    The
    single list of column or table arguments passed to ``select()`` is still
    accepted, however is no longer necessary if expressions are passed in a
    simple positional style.   Other keyword arguments are disallowed when this
    form is used.
