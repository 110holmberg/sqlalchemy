    Fixed critical memory issue identified in cache key generation, where for
    very large and complex ORM statements that make use of lots of ORM aliases
    with subqueries, cache key generation could produce excessively large keys
    that were orders of magnitude bigger than the statement itself. Much thanks
    to Rollo Konig Brock for their very patient, long term help in finally
    identifying this issue.
