    Fixed issue where the :func:`_orm.as_declarative` decorator and similar
    functions used to generate the declarative base class would not copy the
    ``__class_getitem__()`` method from a given superclass, which prevented the
    use of pep-484 generics in conjunction with the ``Base`` class. Pull
    request courtesy Kai Mueller.
