    The automatic uniquing of rows on the client side is turned off for the new
    :term:`2.0 style` of ORM querying.  This improves both clarity and
    performance.  However, uniquing of rows on the client side is generally
    necessary when using joined eager loading for collections, as there
    will be duplicates of the primary entity for each element in the
    collection because a join was used.  This uniquing must now be manually
    enabled and can be achieved using the new
    :meth:`_engine.Result.unique` modifier.   To avoid silent failure, the ORM
    explicitly requires the method be called when the result of an ORM
    query in 2.0 style makes use of joined load collections.    The newer
    :func:`_orm.selectinload` strategy is likely preferable for eager loading
    of collections in any case.
