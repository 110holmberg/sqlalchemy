    Fixed regression in dynamic loader strategy and :func:`_orm.relationship`
    overall where the :paramref:`_orm.relationship.order_by` parameter were
    stored as a mutable list, which could then be mutated when combined with
    additional "order_by" methods used against the dynamic query object,
    causing the ORDER BY criteria to continue to grow repetitively.
