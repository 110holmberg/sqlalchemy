    Fixed regression from 1.3 where the "subqueryload" loader strategy would
    fail with a stack trace if used against a query that made use of
    :meth:`_orm.Query.from_statement` or :meth:`_sql.Select.from_statement`. As
    subqueryload requires modifying the original statement, it's not compatible
    with the "from_statement" use case, especially for statements made against
    the :func:`_sql.text` construct. The behavior now is equivalent to that of
    1.3 and previously, which is that the loader strategy silently degrades to
    not be used for such statements, typically falling back to using the
    lazyload strategy.
