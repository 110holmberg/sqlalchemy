    Adjusted the logic added as part of :ticket:`6397` in 1.4.12 so that
    internal mutation of the :class:`.BindParameter` object occurs within the
    clause construction phase as it did before, rather than in the compilation
    phase. In the latter case, the mutation still produced side effects against
    the incoming construct and additionally could potentially interfere with
    other internal mutation routines.
