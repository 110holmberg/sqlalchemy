    Adjusted the dialect initialization process such that the
    :meth:`_engine.Dialect.on_connect` is not called a second time
    on the first connection.   The hook is called first, then the
    :meth:`_engine.Dialect.initialize` is called if that connection is the
    first for that dialect, then no more events are called.   This eliminates
    the two calls to the "on_connect" function which can produce very
    difficult debugging situations.
