    Adjusted :meth:`_orm.Query.union` and similar set operations to be
    correctly compatible with the new capabilities just added in
    :ticket:`6661`, with SQLAlchemy 1.4.19, such that the SELECT statements
    rendered as elements of the UNION or other set operation will include
    directly mapped columns that are mapped as deferred; this both fixes a
    regression involving unions with multiple levels of nesting that would
    produce a column mismatch, and also allows the :func:`_orm.undefer` option
    to be used at the top level of such a :class:`_orm.Query` without having to
    apply the option to each of the elements within the UNION.
