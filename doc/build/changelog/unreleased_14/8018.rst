    An informative error is raised if two individual :class:`.BindParameter`
    objects share the same name, yet one is used within an "expanding" context
    (typically an IN expression) and the other is not; mixing the same name in
    these two different styles of usage is not supported and typically the
    ``expanding=True`` parameter should be set on the parameters that are to
    receive list values outside of IN expressions (where ``expanding`` is set
    by default).
