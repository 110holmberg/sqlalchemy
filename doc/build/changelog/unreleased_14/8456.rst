    Fixed regression appearing in the 1.4 series where a joined-inheritance
    query placed as a subquery within an enclosing query for that same entity
    would fail to render the JOIN correctly for the inner query. The issue
    manifested in two different ways prior and subsequent to version 1.4.18
    (related issue #6595), in one case rendering JOIN twice, in the other
    losing the JOIN entirely. To resolve, the conditions under which
    "polymorphic loading" are applied have been scaled back to not be invoked
    for simple joined inheritance queries.
