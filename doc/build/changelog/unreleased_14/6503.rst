    :tickets: 6503, 6253

    Fixed further regressions in the same area as that of :ticket:`6052` where
    loader options as well as invocations of methods like
    :meth:`_orm.Query.join` would fail if the left side of the statement for
    which the option/join depends upon were replaced by using the
    :meth:`_orm.Query.with_entities` method, or when using 2.0 style queries
    when using the :meth:`_sql.Select.with_only_columns` method. A new set of
    state has been added to the objects which tracks the "left" entities that
    the options / join were made against which is memoized when the lead
    entities are changed.
