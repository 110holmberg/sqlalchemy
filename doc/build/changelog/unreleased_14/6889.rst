    Adjusted ORM loader internals to no longer use the "lambda caching" system
    that was added in 1.4, as well as repaired one location that was still
    using the previous "baked query" system for a query. The lambda caching
    system remains an effective way to reduce the overhead of building up
    queries that have relatively fixed usage patterns. In the case of loader
    strategies, the queries used are responsible for moving through lots of
    arbitrary options and criteria, which is both generated and sometimes
    consumed by end-user code, that make the lambda cache concept not any more
    efficient than not using it, at the cost of more complexity. In particular
    the problems noted by :ticket:`6881` and :ticket:`6887` are made are made
    considerably less complicated by removing this feature internally.

     Fixed an issue where the :class:`_orm.Bundle` construct would not create
     proper cache keys, leading to inefficient use of the query cache.  This
     had some impact on the "selectinload" strategy and was identified as
     part of :ticket:`6889`.
