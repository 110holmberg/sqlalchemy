    Made corrections to the default pytest configuration regarding how test
    discovery is configured, to fix issue where the test suite would not
    configure warnings correctly and also attempt to load example suites as
    tests, in the specific case where the SQLAlchemy checkout were located in
    an absolute path that had a super-directory named "test".
