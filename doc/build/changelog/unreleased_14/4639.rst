.. change::
    :tags: performance, sql
    :tickets: 4639

    An all-encompassing reorganization and refactoring of Core and ORM
    internals now allows all Core and ORM statements within the areas of
    DQL (e.g. SELECTs) and DML (e.g. INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to allow their
    SQL compilation as well as the construction of result-fetching metadata
    to be fully cached in most cases.   This effectively provides a transparent
    and generalized version of what the "Baked Query" extension has offered
    for the ORM in past versions.  The new feature can calculate the
    cache key for any given SQL construction based on the string that
    it would ultimately produce for a given dialect, allowing functions that
    compose the equivalent select(), Query(), insert(), update() or delete()
    object each time to have that statement cached after it's generated
    the first time.

    The feature is enabled transparently but includes some new programming
    paradigms that may be employed to make the caching even more efficient.
