    Fixed Mypy crash which would occur when using Mypy plugin against code
    which made use of :class:`_orm.declared_attr` methods for non-mapped names
    like ``__mapper_args__``, ``__table_args__``, or other dunder names, as the
    plugin would try to interpret these as mapped attributes which would then
    be later mis-handled. As part of this change, the decorated function is
    still converted by the plugin into a generic assignment statement (e.g.
    ``__mapper_args__: Any``) so that the argument signature can continue to be
    annotated in the same way one would for any other ``@classmethod`` without
    Mypy complaining about the wrong argument type for a method that isn't
    explicitly ``@classmethod``.
