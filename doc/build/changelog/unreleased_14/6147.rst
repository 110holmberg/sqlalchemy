    Applied a series of refactorings and fixes to accommodate for Mypy
    "incremental" mode across multiple files, which previously was not taken
    into account. In this mode the Mypy plugin has to accommodate Python
    datatypes expressed in other files coming in with less information than
    they have on a direct run.

    Additionally, a new decorator :func:`_orm.declarative_mixin` is added,
    which is necessary for the Mypy plugin to be able to definifitely identify
    a Declarative mixin class that is otherwise not used inside a particular
    Python file.
