    :tickets: 6066

    Fixed regression where producing a Core expression construct such as
    :func:`_sql.select` using ORM entities would eagerly configure the mappers,
    in an effort to maintain compatibility with the :class:`_orm.Query` object
    which necessarily does this to support many backref-related legacy cases.
    However, core :func:`_sql.select` constructs are also used in mapper
    configurations and such, and to that degree this eager configuration is
    more of an inconvenience, so eager configure has been disabled for the
    :func:`_sql.select` and other Core constructs in the absence of ORM loading
    types of functions such as :class:`_orm.Load`.

    The change maintains the behavior of :class:`_orm.Query` so that backwards
    compatibility is maintained. However, when using a :func:`_sql.select` in
    conjunction with ORM entities, a "backref" that isn't explicitly placed on
    one of the classes until mapper configure time won't be available unless
    :func:`_orm.configure_mappers` or the newer :func:`_orm.registry.configure`
    has been called elsewhere. Prefer using
    :paramref:`_orm.relationship.back_populates` for more explicit relationship
    configuration which does not have the eager configure requirement.
