    Added support for PostgreSQL "readonly" and "deferrable" flags for all of
    psycopg2, asyncpg and pg8000 dialects.   This takes advantage of a newly
    generalized version of the "isolation level" API to support other kinds of
    session attributes set via execution options that are reliably reset
    when connections are returned to the connection pool.
