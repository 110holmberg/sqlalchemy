    Implemented support for the psycopg2 ``execute_values()`` extension
    within the ORM flush process via the enhancements to Core made
    in :ticket:`5401`, so that this extension is used
    both as a strategy to batch INSERT statements together as well as
    that RETURNING may now be used among multiple parameter sets to
    retrieve primary key values back in batch.   This allows nearly
    all INSERT statements emitted by the ORM on behalf of PostgreSQL
    to be submitted in batch and also via the ``execute_values()``
    extension which benches at five times faster than plain
    executemany() for this particular backend.
