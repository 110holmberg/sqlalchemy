    Fixed issue where if an exception occurred when the :class:`_orm.Session`
    were to close the connection within the :meth:`_orm.Session.commit` method,
    when using a context manager for :meth:`_orm.Session.begin` , it would
    attempt a rollback which would not be possible as the :class:`_orm.Session`
    was in between where the transaction is committed and the connection is
    then to be returned to the pool, raising the exception "this
    sessiontransaction is in the committed state". This exception can occur
    mostly in an asyncio context where CancelledError can be raised.
