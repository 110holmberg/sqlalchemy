    Fixed issue in new "loader criteria" method
    :meth:`_orm.PropComparator.and_` where usage with a loader strategy like
    :func:`_orm.selectinload` against a column that was a member of the ``.c.``
    collection of a subquery object, where the subquery would be dynamically
    added to the FROM clause of the statement, would be subject to stale
    parameter values within the subquery in the SQL statement cache, as the
    process used by the loader strategy to replace the parameters at execution
    time would fail to accommodate the subquery when received in this form.
