    Added new attributes :attr:`.UpdateBase.returning_column_descriptions` and
    :attr:`.UpdateBase.entity_description` to allow for inspection of ORM
    attributes and entities that are installed as part of an :class:`.Insert`,
    :class:`.Update`, or :class:`.Delete` construct. The
    :attr:`.Select.column_descriptions` accessor is also now implemented for
    Core-only selectables.
