    Fixed issue where using the feature of using a string label for ordering or
    grouping described at :ref:`tutorial_order_by_label` would fail to function
    correctly if used on a :class:`.CTE` construct, when the CTE were embedded
    inside of an enclosing :class:`_sql.Select` statement that itself was set
    up as a scalar subquery.
