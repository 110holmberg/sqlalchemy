    For the PostgreSQL and SQL Server dialects only, adjusted the compiler so
    that when rendering column expressions in the RETURNING clause, the "non
    anon" label that's used in SELECT statements is suggested for SQL
    expression elements that generate a label; the primary example is a SQL
    function that may be emitting as part of the column's type, where the label
    name should match the column's name by default. This restores a not-well
    defined behavior that had changed in version 1.4.21 due to :ticket:`6718`,
    :ticket:`6710`. The Oracle dialect has a different RETURNING implementation
    and was not affected by this issue. Version 2.0 features an across the
    board change for its widely expanded support of RETURNING on other
    backends.

    :tags: bug, oracle

    Fixed issue in the Oracle dialect where an INSERT statement that used
    ``insert(some_table).values(...).returning(some_table)`` against a full
    :class:`.Table` object at once would fail to execute, raising an exception.
