    Fixed regression where a connection pool event specified with a keyword,
    most notably ``insert=True``, would be lost when the event were set up.
    This would prevent startup events that need to fire before dialect-level
    events from working correctly.

    :tickets: 5708, 5497

    The internal mechanics of the engine connection routine has been altered
    such that it's now guaranteed that a user-defined event handler for the
    :meth:`_pool.PoolEvents.connect` handler, when established using
    ``insert=True``, will allow an event handler to run that is definitely
    invoked **before** any dialect-specific initialization starts up, most
    notably when it does things like detect default schema name.
    Previously, this would occur in most cases but not unconditionally.
    A new example is added to the schema documentation illustrating how to
    establish the "default schema name" within an on-connect event.

.. change::
    :tags: usecase, postgresql

    Added a read/write ``.autocommit`` attribute to the DBAPI-adaptation layer
    for the asyncpg dialect.   This so that when working with DBAPI-specific
    schemes that need to use "autocommit" directly with the DBAPI connection,
    the same ``.autocommit`` attribute which works with both psycopg2 as well
    as pg8000 is available.
