    Python 3.10 has deprecated "distutils" in favor of explicit use of
    "setuptools" in :pep:`632`; SQLAlchemy's setup.py has replaced imports
    accordingly. However, since setuptools itself only recently added the
    replacement symbols mentioned in pep-632 as of November of 2022 in version
    59.0.1, ``setup.py`` still has fallback imports to distutils, as SQLAlchemy
    1.4 does not have a hard setuptools versioning requirement at this time.
    SQLAlchemy 2.0 is expected to use a full :pep:`517` installation layout
    which will indicate appropriate setuptools versioning up front.
