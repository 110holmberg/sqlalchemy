    Fixed regression in "dynamic" loader strategy where the
    :meth:`_orm.Query.filter_by` method would not be given an appropriate
    entity to filter from, in the case where a "secondary" table were present
    in the relationship being queried and the mapping were against something
    complex such as a "with polymorphic".
