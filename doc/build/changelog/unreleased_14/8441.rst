    Fixed issue where use of the :func:`_sql.table` construct, passing a string
    for the :paramref:`_sql.table.schema` parameter, would fail to take the
    "schema" string into account when producing a cache key, thus leading to
    caching collisions if multiple, same-named :func:`_sql.table` constructs
    with different schemas were used.
