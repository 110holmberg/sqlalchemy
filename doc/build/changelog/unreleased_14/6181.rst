    Fixed regression where use of the :meth:`.Operators.in_` method with a
    :class:`_sql.Select` object against a non-table-bound column would produce
    an ``AttributeError``, or more generally using a :class:`_sql.ScalarSelect`
    that has no datatype in a binary expression would produce invalid state.
