    Fixed a small regression where the query for "show
    standard_conforming_strings" upon initialization would be emitted even if
    the server version info were detected as less than version 8.2, previously
    it would only occur for server version 8.2 or greater. The query fails on
    Amazon Redshift which reports a PG server version older than this value.
