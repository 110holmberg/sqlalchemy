    :tickets: 4392

    Fixed issue in psycopg2 dialect where the "multiple hosts" feature
    implemented for :ticket:`4392`, where multiple ``host:port`` pairs could be
    passed in the query string as
    ``?host=host1:port1&host=host2:port2&host=host3:port3`` was not implemented
    correctly, as it did not propagate the "port" parameter appropriately.
    Connections that didn't use a different "port" likely worked without issue,
    and connections that had "port" for some of the entries may have
    incorrectly passed on that hostname. The format is now corrected to pass
    hosts/ports appropriately.

    As part of this change, maintained support for another multihost style that
    worked unintentionally, which is comma-separated
    ``?host=h1,h2,h3&port=p1,p2,p3``. This format is more consistent with
    libpq's query-string format, whereas the previous format is inspired by a
    different aspect of libpq's URI format but is not quite the same thing.

    If the two styles are mixed together, an error is raised as this is
    ambiguous.
