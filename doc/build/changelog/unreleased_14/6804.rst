    Added support for SQLAlchemy classes to be defined in user code using
    "generic class" syntax as defined by ``sqlalchemy2-stubs``, e.g.
    ``Column[String]``, without the need for qualifying these constructs within
    a ``TYPE_CHECKING`` block by implementing the Python special method
    ``__class_getitem__()``, which allows this syntax to pass without error at
    runtime.
