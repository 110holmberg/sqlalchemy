    Fixed ORM issue where column expressions passed to ``query()`` or
    ORM-enabled ``select()`` would be deduplicated on the identity of the
    object, such as a phrase like ``select(A.id, null(), null())`` would
    produce only one "NULL" expression, which previously was not the case in
    1.3. However, the change also allows for ORM expressions to render as given
    as well, such as ``select(A.data, A.data)`` will produce a result row with
    two columns.
