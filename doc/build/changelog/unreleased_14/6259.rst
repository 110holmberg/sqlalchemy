    Fixed a cache leak involving the :func:`_orm.with_expression` loader
    option, where the given SQL expression would not be correctly considered as
    part of the cache key.

    Additionally, fixed regression involving the corresponding
    :func:`_orm.query_expression` feature. While the bug technically exists in
    1.3 as well, it was not exposed until 1.4. The "default expr" value of
    ``null()`` would be rendered when not needed, and additionally was also not
    adapted correctly when the ORM rewrites statements such as when using
    joined eager loading. The fix ensures "singleton" expressions like ``NULL``
    and ``true`` aren't "adapted" to refer to columns in ORM statements, and
    additionally ensures that a :func:`_orm.query_expression` with no default
    expression doesn't render in the statement if a
    :func:`_orm.with_expression` isn't used.
