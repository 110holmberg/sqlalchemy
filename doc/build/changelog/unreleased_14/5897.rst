    Mapper "configuration", which occurs within the
    :func:`_orm.configure_mappers` function, is now organized to be on a
    per-registry basis. This allows for example the mappers within a certain
    declarative base to be configured, but not those of another base that is
    also present in memory. The goal is to provide a means of reducing
    application startup time by only running the "configure" process for sets
    of mappers that are needed. This also adds the
    :meth:`_orm.registry.configure` method that will run configure for the
    mappers local in a particular registry only.
