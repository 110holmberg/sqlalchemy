    Fixed regression in mariadbconnector dialect as of mariadb connector 1.0.10
    where the DBAPI no longer pre-buffers cursor.lastrowid, leading to errors
    when inserting objects with the ORM as well as causing non-availability of
    the :attr:`_result.CursorResult.inserted_primary_key` attribute. The
    dialect now fetches this value proactively for situations where it applies.
