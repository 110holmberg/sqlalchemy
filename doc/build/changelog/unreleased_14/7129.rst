    :tickets: 7129

    Fixed bug in SQL Server :class:`_mssql.DATETIMEOFFSET` datatype where the
    ODBC implementation would not generate the correct DDL, for cases where the
    type were converted using the ``dialect.type_descriptor()`` method, the
    usage of which is illustrated in some documented examples for
    :class:`.TypeDecorator`, though not necessary for most datatypes.
    Regression was introduced by :ticket:`6366`. As part of this change, the
    full list of SQL Server date types have been amended to return a "dialect
    impl" that generates the same DDL name as the supertype.
