    Fixed caching-related issue where the use of a loader option of the form
    ``lazyload(aliased(A).bs).joinedload(B.cs)`` would fail to result in the
    joinedload being invoked for runs subsequent to the query being cached, due
    to a mismatch for the options / object path applied to the objects loaded
    for a query with a lead entity that used ``aliased()``.
