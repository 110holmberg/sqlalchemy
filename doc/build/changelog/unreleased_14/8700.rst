    Fixed regression which occurred throughout the 1.4 series where the
    :meth:`.Inspector.has_table` method, which historically reported on views
    as well, stopped working for SQL Server. The issue is not present in the
    2.0 series which uses a different reflection architecture. Test support is
    added to ensure ``has_table()`` remains working per spec re: views.
