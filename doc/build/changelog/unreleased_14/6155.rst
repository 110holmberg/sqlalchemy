    Modified the context manager used by :class:`_engine.Transaction` so that
    an "already detached" warning is not emitted by the ending of the context
    manager itself, if the transaction were already manually rolled back inside
    the block. This applies to regular transactions, savepoint transactions,
    and legacy "marker" transactions. A warning is still emitted if the
    ``.rollback()`` method is called explicitly more than once.
