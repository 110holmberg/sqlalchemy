    Fixed regression caused by :ticket:`6306` which added support for
    ``DateTime(timezone=True)``, where the previous behavior of the pyodbc
    driver of implicitly dropping the tzinfo from a timezone-aware date when
    INSERTing into a timezone-naive DATETIME column were lost, leading to a SQL
    Server error when inserting timezone-aware datetime objects into
    timezone-native database columns.
