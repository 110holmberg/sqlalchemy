    Added accessors ``.sqlstate`` and synonym ``.pgcode`` to the ``.orig``
    attribute of the SQLAlchemy exception class raised by the asyncpg DBAPI
    adapter, that is, the intermediary exception object that wraps on top of
    that raised by the asyncpg library itself, but below the level of the
    SQLAlchemy dialect.
