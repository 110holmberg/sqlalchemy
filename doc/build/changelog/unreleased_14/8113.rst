    :tags: bug, sql
    :tickets: 8113

    Adjusted the fix made for :ticket:`8056` which adjusted the escaping of
    bound parameter names with special characters such that the escaped names
    were translated after the SQL compilation step, which broke a published
    recipe on the FAQ illustrating how to merge parameter names into the string
    output of a compiled SQL string. The change restores the escaped names that
    come from ``compiled.params`` and adds a conditional parameter to
    :meth:`.SQLCompiler.construct_params` named ``escape_names`` that defaults
    to ``True``, restoring the old behavior by default.
