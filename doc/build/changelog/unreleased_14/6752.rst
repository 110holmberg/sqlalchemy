    Added new method :meth:`_sql.HasCTE.add_cte` to each of the
    :func:`_sql.select`, :func:`_sql.insert`, :func:`_sql.update` and
    :func:`_sql.delete` constructs. This method will add the given
    :class:`_sql.CTE` as an "independent" CTE of the statement, meaning it
    renders in the WITH clause above the statement unconditionally even if it
    is not otherwise referenced in the primary statement. This is a popular use
    case on the PostgreSQL database where a CTE is used for a DML statement
    that runs against database rows independently of the primary statement.
