    Fixed regression where an attribute that is mapped to a
    :func:`_orm.synonym` could not be used in column loader options such as
    :func:`_orm.load_only`.

.. change::
    :tags: usecase, orm
    :tickets: 6267

    Established support for :func:`_orm.synoynm` in conjunction with
    hybrid property, assocaitionproxy is set up completely, including that
    synonyms can be established linking to these constructs which work
    fully.   This is a behavior that was semi-explicitly disallowed previously,
    however since it did not fail in every scenario, explicit support
    for assoc proxy and hybrids has been added.
