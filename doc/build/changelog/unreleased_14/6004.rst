    Fixed a regression where the "reset agent" of the connection pool wasn't
    really being utilized by the :class:`_engine.Connection` when it were
    closed, and also leading to a double-rollback scenario that was somewhat
    wasteful.   The newer architecture of the engine has been updated so that
    the connection pool "reset-on-return" logic will be skipped when the
    :class:`_engine.Connection` explicitly closes out the transaction before
    returning the pool to the connection.
