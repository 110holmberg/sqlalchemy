    The maximum buffer size for the :class:`.BufferedRowResultProxy`, which
    is used by dialects such as PostgreSQL when ``stream_results=True``, can
    now be set to a number greater than 1000 and the buffer will grow to
    that size.  Previously, the buffer would not go beyond 1000 even if the
    value were set larger.   The growth of the buffer is also now based
    on a simple multiplying factor currently set to 5.  Pull request courtesy
