    Fixed a memory leak in the C extensions which could occur when calling upon
    named members of :class:`.Row` when the member does not exist under Python
    3; in particular this could occur during numpy transformations when it
    attempts to call members such as ``.__array__``, but the issue was
    surrounding any ``AttributeError`` thrown by the :class:`.Row` object. This
    issue does not apply to version 2.0 which has already transitioned to
    Cython. Thanks much to Sebastian Berg for identifying the problem.
