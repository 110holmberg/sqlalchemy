    Fixed issue in new :class:`_sql.Values` construct where passing tuples of
    objects would fall back to per-value type detection rather than making use
    of the :class:`_schema.Column` objects passed directly to
    :class:`_sql.Values` that tells SQLAlchemy what the expected type is. This
    would lead to issues for objects such as enumerations and numpy strings
    that are not actually necessary since the expected type is given.
