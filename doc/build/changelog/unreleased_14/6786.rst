    Fixed issue where use of the :paramref:`_sql.case.whens` parameter passing
    a dictionary positionally and not as a keyword argument would emit a 2.0
    deprecation warning, referring to the deprecation of passing a list
    positionally. The dictionary format of "whens", passed positionally, is
    still supported and was accidentally marked as deprecated.
