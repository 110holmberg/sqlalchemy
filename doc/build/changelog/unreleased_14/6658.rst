    Fixed bug where the "schema_translate_map" feature would fail to function
    correctly in conjunction with an INSERT into a table that has an IDENTITY
    column, where the value of the IDENTITY column were specified in the values
    of the INSERT thus triggering SQLAlchemy's feature of setting IDENTITY
    INSERT to "on"; it's in this directive where the schema translate map would
    fail to be honored.
