    Fixed issue when using :paramref:`_orm.relationship.cascade_backrefs`
    parameter set to ``False``, which per :ref:`change_5150` is set to become
    the standard behavior in SQLAlchemy 2.0, where adding the item to a
    collection that uniquifies, such as ``set`` or ``dict`` would fail to fire
    a cascade event if the object were already associated in that collection
    via the backref. This fix represents a fundamental change in the collection
    mechanics by introducing a new event state which can fire off for a
    collection mutation even if there is no net change on the collection; the
    action is now suited using a new event hook
    :meth:`_orm.AttributeEvents.append_wo_mutation`.
