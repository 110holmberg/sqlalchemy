    Added ``asyncio.exceptions.TimeoutError``,
    ``asyncio.exceptions.CancelledError`` as so-called "exit exceptions", a
    class of exceptions that include things like ``GreenletExit`` and
    ``KeyboardInterrupt``, which are considered to be events that warrant
    considering a DBAPI connection to be in an unusable state where it should
    be recycled.
