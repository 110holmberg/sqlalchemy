    Improved engine logging to note ROLLBACK and COMMIT which is logged while
    the DBAPI driver is in AUTOCOMMIT mode. These ROLLBACK/COMMIT are library
    level and do not have any effect when AUTOCOMMIT is in effect, however it's
    still worthwhile to log as these indicate where SQLAlchemy sees the
    "transaction" demarcation.
