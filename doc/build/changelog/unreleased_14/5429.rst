    Several operators are renamed to achieve more consistent naming across
    SQLAlchemy.

    The operator changes are:

    * `isnot` is now `is_not`
    * `not_in_` is now `not_in`

    Because these are core operators, the internal migration strategy for this
    change is to support legacy terms for an extended period of time -- if not
    indefinitely -- but update all documentation, tutorials, and internal usage
    to the new terms.  The new terms are used to define the functions, and
    the legacy terms have been deprecated into aliases of the new terms.
