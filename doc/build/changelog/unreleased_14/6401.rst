    Fixed regression in hybrid_property where a hybrid against a SQL function
    would generate an ``AttributeError`` when attempting to generate an entry
    for the ``.c`` collection of a subquery in some cases; among other things
    this would impact its use in cases like that of ``Query.count()``.
