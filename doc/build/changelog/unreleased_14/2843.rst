    Added parameters :paramref:`_ddl.CreateTable.if_not_exists`,
    :paramref:`_ddl.CreateIndex.if_not_exists`,
    :paramref:`_ddl.DropTable.if_exists` and
    :paramref:`_ddl.DropIndex.if_exists` to the :class:`_ddl.CreateTable`,
    :class:`_ddl.DropTable`, :class:`_ddl.CreateIndex` and
    :class:`_ddl.DropIndex` constructs which result in "IF NOT EXISTS" / "IF
    EXISTS" DDL being added to the CREATE/DROP. These phrases are not accepted
    by all databases and the operation will fail on a database that does not
    support it as there is no similarly compatible fallback within the scope of
    a single DDL statement.  Pull request courtesy Ramon Williams.
