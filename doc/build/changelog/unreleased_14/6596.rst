    Fixed regression involving how the ORM would resolve a given mapped column
    to a result row, where under cases such as joined eager loading, a slightly
    more expensive "fallback" could take place to set up this resolution due to
    some logic that was removed since 1.3. The issue could also cause
    deprecation warnings involving column resolution to be emitted when using a
    1.4 style query with joined eager loading.
