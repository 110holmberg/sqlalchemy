    Fixed a two issues where combinations of ``select()`` and ``join()`` when
    adapted to form a copy of the element would not completely copy the state
    of all column objects associated with subqueries. A key problem this caused
    is that usage of the :meth:`_sql.ClauseElement.params` method (which should
    probably be moved into a legacy category as it is inefficient and error
    prone) would leave copies of the old :class:`_sql.BindParameter` objects
    around, leading to issues in correctly setting the parameters at execution
    time.
