    Fixed issue where usage of an explicit :class:`.Sequence` would produce
    inconsistent "inline" behavior for an :class:`.Insert` construct that
    includes multiple values phrases; the first seq would be inline but
    subsequent ones would be "pre-execute", leading to inconsistent sequence
    ordering. The sequence expressions are now fully inline.
