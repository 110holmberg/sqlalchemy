    The unit of work process now turns off all "lazy='raise'" behavior
    altogether when a flush is proceeding.  While there are areas where the UOW
    is sometimes loading things that aren't ultimately needed, the lazy="raise"
    strategy is not helpful here as the user often does not have much control
    or visibility into the flush process.
