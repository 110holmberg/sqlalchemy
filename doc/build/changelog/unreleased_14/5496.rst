    Added a new dialect token "mariadb" that may be used in place of "mysql" in
    the :func:`_sa.create_engine` URL.  This will deliver a MariaDB dialect
    subclass of the MySQLDialect in use that forces the "is_mariadb" flag to
    True.  The dialect will raise an error if a server version string that does
    not indicate MariaDB in use is received.   This is useful for
    MariaDB-specific testing scenarios as well as to support applications that
    are hardcoding to MariaDB-only concepts.  As MariaDB and MySQL featuresets
    and usage patterns continue to diverge, this pattern may become more
    prominent.
