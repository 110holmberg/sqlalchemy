    Fixed regression where the :paramref:`.Bundle.single_entity` flag would
    take effect for a :class:`.Bundle` even though it were not set.
    Additionally, this flag is legacy as it only makes sense for the
    :class:`_orm.Query` object and not 2.0 style execution.  a deprecation
    warning is emitted when used with new-style execution.
