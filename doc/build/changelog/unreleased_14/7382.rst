    Fixed reflection of covering indexes to report ``include_columns`` as part
    of the ``dialect_options`` entry in the reflected index dictionary, thereby
    enabling round trips from reflection->create to be complete. Included
    columns continue to also be present under the ``include_columns`` key for
    backwards compatibility.
