    Using strings to represent relationship names in ORM operations such as
    :meth:`_orm.Query.join`, as well as strings for all ORM attribute names
    in loader options like :func:`_orm.selectinload`
    is deprecated and will be removed in SQLAlchemy 2.0.  The class-bound
    attribute should be passed instead.  This provides much better specificity
    to the given method, allows for modifiers such as ``of_type()``, and
    reduces internal complexity.

    Additionally, the ``aliased`` and ``from_joinpoint`` parameters to
    :meth:`_orm.Query.join` are also deprecated.   The :func:`_orm.aliased`
    construct now provides for a great deal of flexibility and capability
    and should be used directly.
