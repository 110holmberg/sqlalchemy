    Fixed recursion overflow which could occur within ORM statement compilation
    when using either the :func:`_orm.with_loader_criteria` feature or the the
    :meth:`_orm.PropComparator.and_` method within a loader strategy in
    conjunction with a subquery which referred to the same entity being altered
    by the criteria option, or loaded by the loader strategy.  A check for
    coming across the same loader criteria option in a recursive fashion has
    been added to accommodate for this scenario.
