    Fixed issue where the ``literal_binds`` compiler flag, as used externally
    to render bound parameters inline, would fail to work when used with a
    certain class of parameters known as "literal_execute", which covers things
    like LIMIT and OFFSET values for dialects where the drivers don't allow a
    bound parameter, such as SQL Server's "TOP" clause.  The issue locally
    seemed to affect only the MSSQL dialect.
