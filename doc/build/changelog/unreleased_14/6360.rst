    Fixed issue where the new :ref:`session_autobegin` behavior failed to
    "autobegin" in the case where an existing persistent object has an
    attribute change, which would then impact the behavior of
    :meth:`_orm.Session.rollback` in that no snapshot was created to be rolled
    back. The "attribute modify" mechanics have been updated to ensure
    "autobegin", which does not perform any database work, does occur when
    persistent attributes change in the same manner as when
    :meth:`_orm.Session.add` is called. This is a regression as in 1.3, the
    rollback() method always had a transaction to roll back and would expire
    every time.
