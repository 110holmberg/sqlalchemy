    Fixed regression which appeared in 1.4.23 which could cause loader options
    to be mis-handled in some cases, in particular when using joined table
    inheritance in combination with the ``polymorphic_load="selectin"`` option
    as well as relationship lazy loading, leading to a ``TypeError``.
