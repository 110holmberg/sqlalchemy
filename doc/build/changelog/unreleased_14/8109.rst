    Fixed issue where a :func:`_orm.with_loader_criteria` option could not be
    pickled, as is necessary when it is carried along for propagation to lazy
    loaders in conjunction with a caching scheme. Currently, the only form that
    is supported as picklable is to pass the "where criteria" as a fixed
    module-level callable function that produces a SQL expression. An ad-hoc
    "lambda" can't be pickled, and a SQL expression object is usually not fully
    picklable directly.
