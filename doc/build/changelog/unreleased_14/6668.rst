    Fixed the class hierarchy for the :class:`_schema.Sequence` and the more
    general :class:`_schema.DefaultGenerator` base, as these are "executable"
    as statements they need to include :class:`_sql.Executable` in their
    hierarchy, not just :class:`_roles.StatementRole` as was applied
    arbitrarily to :class:`_schema.Sequence` previously. The fix allows
    :class:`_schema.Sequence` to work in all ``.execute()`` methods including
    with :meth:`_orm.Session.execute` which was not working in the case that a
    ``do_orm_execute()`` handler was also established.
