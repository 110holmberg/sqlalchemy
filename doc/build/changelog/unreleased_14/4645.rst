    The "expanding IN" feature, which generates IN expressions at query
    execution time which are based on the particular parameters associated with
    the statement execution, is now used for all IN expressions made against
    lists of literal values.   This allows IN expressions to be fully cacheable
    independently of the list of values being passed, and also includes support
    for empty lists. For any scenario where the IN expression contains
    non-literal SQL expressions, the old behavior of pre-rendering for each
    position in the IN is maintained. The change also completes support for
    expanding IN with tuples, where previously type-specific bind processors
    weren't taking effect.
