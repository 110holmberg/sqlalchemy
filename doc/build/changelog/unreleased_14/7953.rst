    Added a warning regarding a bug which exists in the :meth:`.Result.columns`
    method when passing 0 for the index in conjunction with a :class:`.Result`
    that will return a single ORM entity, which indicates that the current
    behavior of :meth:`.Result.columns` is broken in this case as the
    :class:`.Result` object will yield scalar values and not :class:`.Row`
    objects. The issue will be fixed in 2.0, which would be a
    backwards-incompatible change for code that relies on the current broken
    behavior. Code which wants to receive a collection of scalar values should
    use the :meth:`.Result.scalars` method, which will return a new
    :class:`.ScalarResult` object that yields non-row scalar objects.
