    A warning is emitted when calling upon the :meth:`.Result.columns` method
    with only one index, in particular ORM related cases, indicating that the
    current behavior of :meth:`.Result.columns` is broken in this case and
    will be changed in 2.0.  To receive a collection of scalar values,
    use the :meth:`.Result.scalars` method.
