    Fixed issue where deferred polymorphic loading of attributes from a
    joined-table inheritance subclass would fail to populate the attribute
    correctly if the :func:`_orm.load_only` option were used to originally
    exclude that attribute, in the case where the load_only were descending
    from a relationship loader option.  The fix allows that other valid options
    such as ``defer(..., raiseload=True)`` etc. still function as expected.
