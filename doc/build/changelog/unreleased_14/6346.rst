    Adjusted the declarative scan for dataclasses so that the inheritance
    behavior of :func:`_orm.declared_attr` established on a mixin, when using
    the new form of having it inside of a ``dataclasses.field()`` construct and
    not actually a descriptor attribute on the class, correctly accommodates
    the case when the target class to be mapped is a subclass of an existing
    mapped class which has already mapped that :func:`_orm.declared_attr`, and
    therefore should not be re-applied to this class.
