    Fixed regression in ORM where using hybrid property to indicate an
    expression from a different entity would confuse the column-labeling logic
    in the ORM and attempt to derive the name of the hybrid from that other
    class, leading to an attribute error. The owning class of the hybrid
    attribute is now tracked along with the name.
