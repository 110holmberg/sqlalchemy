    Adjusted the "from linter" warning feature to accommodate for a chain of
    joins more than one level deep where the ON clauses don't explicitly match
    up the targets, such as an expression such as "ON TRUE". This mode of use
    is intended to cancel the cartesian product warning simply by the fact that
    there's a JOIN from "a to b", which was not working for the case where the
    chain of joins had more than one element.

    Added the "is_comparison" flag to the PostgreSQL "overlaps",
    "contained_by", "contains" operators, so that they work in relevant ORM
    contexts as well as in conjunction with the "from linter" feature.
