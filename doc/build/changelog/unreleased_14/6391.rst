    Fixed critical regression where bound parameter tracking as used in the SQL
    caching system could fail to track all parameters for the case where the
    same SQL expression containing a parameter were used in an ORM-related
    query using a feature such as class inheritance, which was then embedded in
    an enclosing expression which would make use of that same expression
    multiple times, such as a UNION. The ORM would individually copy the
    individual SELECT statements as part of compilation with class inheritance,
    which then embedded in the enclosing statement would fail to accommodate
    for all parameters. The logic that tracks this condition has been adjusted
    to work for multiple copies of a parameter.
