    "Compound select" methods like :meth:`_sql.Select.union`,
    :meth:`_sql.Select.intersect_all` etc. now accept ``*other`` as an argument
    rather than ``other`` to allow for multiple additional SELECTs to be
    compounded with the parent statement at once. In particular, the change as
    applied to :meth:`_sql.CTE.union` and :meth:`_sql.CTE.union_all` now allow
    for a so-called "non-linear CTE" to be created with the :class:`_sql.CTE`
    construct, whereas previously there was no way to have more than two CTE
    sub-elements in a UNION together while still correctly calling upon the CTE
    in recursive fashion. Pull request courtesy Eric Masseran.
