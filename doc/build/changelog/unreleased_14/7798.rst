    Fixed regression caused by :ticket:`7760` where the new capabilities of
    :class:`.TextualSelect` were not fully implemented within the compiler
    properly, leading to issues with composed INSERT constructs such as "INSERT
    FROM SELECT" and "INSERT...ON CONFLICT" when combined with CTE and textual
    statements.
