    Fixed regression where usage of the :func:`_sql.text` construct inside the
    columns clause of a :class:`_sql.Select` construct, which is better handled
    by using a :func:`_sql.literal_column` construct, would nonetheless prevent
    constructs like :func:`_sql.union` from working correctly. Other use cases,
    such as constructing subuqeries, continue to work the same as in prior
    versions where the :func:`_sql.text` construct is silently omitted from the
    collection of exported columns.   Also repairs similar use within the
    ORM.

    Fixed regression involving legacy methods such as
    :meth:`_sql.Select.append_column` where internal assertions would fail.
