    Fixed bug where the PostgreSQL :meth:`_postgresql.Insert.on_conflict`
    method and the SQLite :meth:`_sqlite.Insert.on_conflict` method would both
    fail to correctly accommodate a column with a separate ".key" when
    specifying the column using its key name in the dictionary passed to
    ``set_``, as well as if the :attr:`_sqlite.Insert.excluded` or
    :attr:`_postgresql.Insert.excluded` collection were used as the dictionary
    directly.
