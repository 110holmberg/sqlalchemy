    The Python ``namedtuple()`` has the behavior such that the names ``count``
    and ``index`` will be served as tuple values if the named tuple includes
    those names; if they are absent, then their behavior as methods of
    ``collections.abc.Sequence`` is maintained. Therefore the
    :class:`_result.Row` and :class:`_result.LegacyRow` classes have been fixed
    so that they work in this same way, maintaining the expected behavior for
    database rows that have columns named "index" or "count".
