    Oracle two-phase transactions at a rudimentary level are now no longer
    deprecated. After receiving support from cx_Oracle devs we can provide for
    basic xid + begin/prepare support with some limitations, which will work
    more fully in an upcoming release of cx_Oracle. Two phase "recovery" is not
    currently supported.
