    Fixed regression in the ``sqlalchemy.ext.instrumentation`` extension that
    prevented instrumentation disposal from working completely. This fix
    includes both a 1.4 regression fix as well as a fix for a related issue
    that existed in 1.3 also.   As part of this change, the
    :class:`sqlalchemy.ext.instrumentation.InstrumentationManager` class now
    has a new method ``unregister()``, which replaces the previous method
    ``dispose()``, which was not called as of version 1.4.
