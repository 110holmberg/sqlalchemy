    Fixed bug in new :func:`_orm.with_loader_criteria` feature where using a
    mixin class with :func:`_orm.declared_attr` on an attribute that were
    accessed inside the custom lambda would emit a warning regarding using an
    unmapped declared attr, when the lambda callable were first initialized.
    This warning is now prevented using special instrumentation for this
    lambda initialization step.
