    Repaired the examples in examples/versioned_rows to use SQLAlchemy 1.4 APIs
    correctly; these examples had been missed when API changes like removing
    "passive" from :meth:`_orm.Session.is_modified` were made as well as the
    :meth:`_ormevents.SessionEvents.do_orm_execute()` event hook were added.
