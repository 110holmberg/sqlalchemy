    The ORM can now generate queries previously only available when using
    :class:`_orm.Query` using the :func:`_sql.select` construct directly.
    A new system by which ORM "plugins" may establish themselves within a
    Core :class:`_sql.Select` allow the majority of query building logic
    previously inside of :class:`_orm.Query` to now take place within
    a compilation-level extension for :class:`_sql.Select`.  Similar changes
    have been made for the :class:`_sql.Update` and :class:`_sql.Delete`
    constructs as well.  The constructs when invoked using :meth:`_orm.Session.execute`
    now do ORM-related work within the method. For :class:`_sql.Select`,
    the :class:`_engine.Result` object returned now contains ORM-level
    entities and results.
