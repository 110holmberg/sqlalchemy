Changes and Migration
=====================

SQLAlchemy changelogs and migration guides are now integrated
within the main documentation.

Current Migration Guide
-----------------------

For SQLAlchemy 2.0, there are two separate documents; the "Major Migration
Guide" details how to update a SQLAlchemy 1.4 application to be compatible
under SQLAlchemy 2.0. The "What's New?" document details major new features,
capabilities and behaviors in SQLAlchemy 2.0.
