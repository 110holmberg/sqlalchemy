    Adjusted the logic that emits DROP statements for :class:`_schema.Sequence`
    objects among the dropping of multiple tables, such that all
    :class:`_schema.Sequence` objects are dropped after all tables, even if the
    given :class:`_schema.Sequence` is related only to a :class:`_schema.Table`
    object and not directly to the overall :class:`_schema.MetaData` object.
    The use case supports the same :class:`_schema.Sequence` being associated
    with more than one :class:`_schema.Table` at a time.
