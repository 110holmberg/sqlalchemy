    :versions: 1.4.0b2

    Fixed regression which occured due to :ticket:`5755` which implemented
    isolation level support for Oracle.   It has been reported that many Oracle
    accounts don't actually have permission to query the ``v$transaction``
    view so this feature has been altered to gracefully fallback when it fails
    upon database connect, where the dialect will assume "READ COMMITTED" is
    the default isolation level as was the case prior to SQLAlchemy 1.3.21.
    However, explicit use of the :meth:`_engine.Connection.get_isolation_level`
    method must now necessarily raise an exception, as Oracle databases with
    this restriction explicitly disallow the user from reading the current
    isolation level.
