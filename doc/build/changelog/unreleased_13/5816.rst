    Fixed bug where making use of the :meth:`.TypeEngine.with_variant` method
    on a :class:`.TypeDecorator` type would fail to take into account the
    dialect-specific mappings in use, due to a rule in :class:`.TypeDecorator`
    that was instead attempting to check for chains of :class:`.TypeDecorator`
    instances.
