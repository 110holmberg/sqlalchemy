    A warning is emmitted if a returning() method such as
    :meth:`_sql.Insert.returning` is called multiple times, as this does not
    yet support additive operation.  Version 1.4 will support additive
    operation for this.  Additionally, any combination of the
    :meth:`_sql.Insert.returning` and :meth:`_sql.Insert.return_defaults`
    methods now raises an error as these methods are mutually exclusive;
    previously the operation would fail silently.
