    Fixed bug where an UPDATE statement against a JOIN using MySQL multi-table
    format would fail to include the table prefix for the target table if the
    statement had no WHERE clause, as only the WHERE clause were scanned to
    detect a "multi table update" at that particular point.  The target
    is now also scanned if it's a JOIN to get the leftmost table as the
    primary table and the additional entries as additional FROM entries.
