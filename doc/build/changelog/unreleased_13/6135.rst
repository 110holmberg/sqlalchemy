    The :class:`_sql.Table` object now raises an informative error message if
    it is instantiated without passing at least the :paramref:`_sql.Table.name`
    and :paramref:`_sql.Table.metadata` arguments positionally. Previously, if
    these were passed as keyword arguments, the object would silently fail to
    initialize correctly.
