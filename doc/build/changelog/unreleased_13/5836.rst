    Fixed issue where the stringification that is sometimes called when
    attempting to generate the "key" for the ``.c`` collection on a selectable
    would fail if the column were an unlabeled custom SQL construct using the
    ``sqlalchemy.ext.compiler`` extension, and did not provide a default
    compilation form; while this seems like an unusual case, it can get invoked
    for some ORM scenarios such as when the expression is used in an "order by"
    in combination with joined eager loading.  The issue is that the lack of a
    default compiler function was raising :class:`.CompileError` and not
    :class:`.UnsupportedCompilationError`.
