    Fixed bug first introduced in as some combination of :ticket:`2892`,
    :ticket:`2919` nnd :ticket:`3832` where the attachment events for a
    :class:`_types.TypeDecorator` would be doubled up against the "impl" class,
    if the "impl" were also a :class:`_types.SchemaType`. The real-world case
    is any :class:`_types.TypeDecorator` against :class:`_types.Enum` or
    :class:`_types.Boolean` would get a doubled
    :class:`_schema.CheckConstraint` when the ``create_constraint=True`` flag
    is set.
