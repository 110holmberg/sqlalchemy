    Fixed regression from SQLAlchemy 1.3.20 caused by the fix for
    :ticket:`5462` which adds double-parenthesis for MySQL functional
    expressions in indexes, as is required by the backend, this inadvertently
    extended to include arbitrary :func:`_sql.text` expressions as well as
    Alembic's internal textual component,  which are required by Alembic for
    arbitrary index expressions which don't imply double parenthesis.  The
    check has been narrowed to include only binary/ unary/functional
    expressions directly.
