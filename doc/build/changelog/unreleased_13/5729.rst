    Fixed regression introduced in 1.3.2 for the PostgreSQL dialect, also
    copied out to the MySQL dialect's feature in 1.3.18, where usage of a non
    :class:`_schema.Table` construct such as :func:`_sql.text` as the argument
    to :paramref:`_sql.Select.with_for_update.of` would fail to be accommodated
    correctly within the PostgreSQL or MySQL compilers.
