    Fixed long-lived bug in MySQL dialect where the maximum identifier length
    of 255 was too long for names of all types of constraints, not just
    indexes, all of which have a size limit of 64. As metadata naming
    conventions can create too-long names in this area, apply the limit to the
    identifier generator within the DDL compiler.
