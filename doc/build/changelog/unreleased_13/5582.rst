    The following pool parameters were not being propagated to the new pool
    created when :meth:`_engine.Engine.dispose` were called: ``pre_ping``,
    ``use_lifo``.  Additionally the ``recycle`` and ``reset_on_return``
    parameters were not propagated for the :class:`_engine.AssertionPool`
    class.  These issues have been fixed.
