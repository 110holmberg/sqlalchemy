    Fixed issue where the following pool parameters were not being propagated
    to the new pool created when :meth:`_engine.Engine.dispose` were called:
    ``pre_ping``, ``use_lifo``.  Additionally the ``recycle`` and
    ``reset_on_return`` parameter is now propagated for the
    :class:`_engine.AssertionPool` class.
