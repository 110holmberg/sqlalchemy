    The "skip_locked" keyword used with ``with_for_update()`` will emit a
    warning when used on MariaDB backends, and will then be ignored.   This is
    a deprecated behavior that will raise in SQLAlchemy 1.4, as an application
    that requests "skip locked" is looking for a non-blocking operation which
    is not available on those backends.
