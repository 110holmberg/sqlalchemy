    Added a comprehensive check and an informative error message for the case
    where a mapped class, or a string mapped class name, is passed to
    :paramref:`_orm.relationship.secondary`.  This is an extremely common error
    which warrants a clear message.

    Additionally, added a new rule to the class registry resolution such that
    with regards to the :paramref:`_orm.relationship.secondary` parameter, if a
    mapped class and its table are of the identical string name, the
    :class:`.Table` will be favored when resolving this parameter.   In all
    other cases, the class continues to be favored if a class and table
    share the identical name.
